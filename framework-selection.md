# Framework Selection Reference

Quick-reference tables for selecting the right narrative arc or communication framework based on context.

---

## Framework Selection Protocol

**REQUIRED: Before recommending 2-3 frameworks, complete the full sweep below. Do NOT skip to the Quick Decision Flowchart or heuristic tables -- those exist for reference only, not as shortcuts.**

### Step 1: Score all 10 narrative arcs

For the user's specific combination of audience + purpose + content type + tone, briefly score each arc on fit (1-5):

| Arc | Fit (1-5) | Key reason |
|-----|-----------|------------|
| A) Prestige | | |
| B) Mystery Box | | |
| C) Heist | | |
| D) Time Machine | | |
| E) Trojan Horse | | |
| F) Hero's Journey | | |
| G) Freytag | | |
| H) Columbo | | |
| I) Game of Scene | | |
| J) Rashomon | | |

### Step 2: Score top communication frameworks

Score the 5 most relevant communication frameworks for this content.

### Step 3: Recommend

Present to the user:

1. **Top pick:** Highest-scoring arc + best communication framework pairing. Show skeleton, tradeoffs, emotional preview.
2. **Strong alternative:** Second-highest arc + framework pairing. Show what it does differently.
3. **Dark Horse:** One arc that scored 3+ but is NOT the obvious choice. Explain what unexpected angle it would bring. Label it clearly as "Dark Horse -- [Arc Name]."
4. **Rejection log:** In 2-3 sentences, note why the lowest-scoring arcs don't fit this content. This demonstrates genuine consideration of the full library.

### Why This Protocol Exists

Without the full sweep, recommendations gravitate to the same 4-5 frameworks (Heist, Trojan Horse, Columbo, Prestige, Hero's Journey). The sweep ensures Freytag, Game of Scene, Time Machine, Rashomon, Mystery Box, and less common communication frameworks get genuine consideration.

## The 5 Input Questions

Gather these inputs before running the selection protocol:

1. **WHO is the audience?** (Executive / Technical / General / Mixed / Skeptical)
2. **WHAT are you trying to accomplish?** (Persuade / Inform / Inspire / Align / Entertain)
3. **WHAT is the content type?** (Research / Strategy / Case study / Vision / Update / etc.)
4. **WHAT tone do you want?** (Authoritative / Provocative / Warm / Urgent / Balanced / Visionary)
5. **Does the material have a genuine surprise/reveal?** (Yes --> engagement arcs / No --> efficiency frameworks)

## Arc-by-Arc Quick Reference

| Arc | Core Mechanic | Best For | Avoid When |
|-----|---------------|----------|------------|
| **A) The Prestige** | Pledge, Turn, Prestige (magic trick structure) | Content with a counterintuitive reveal; debunking conventional wisdom | Audience needs quick answers; no genuine surprise exists |
| **B) Mystery Box** | Open loops, False trails, Click | Research findings with unexpected conclusions; investigative reports | Time-constrained executives; material lacks genuine mystery |
| **C) The Heist** | Target, Obstacles, Crew, Execution, Getaway | Strategy presentations; project plans; "how we'll win" pitches | Informational updates; situations where obstacles shouldn't be emphasized |
| **D) Time Machine** | Future-back, Past-forward, Fork | Scenario planning; strategic foresight; decision-point presentations | Historical analysis; content without genuine future uncertainty |
| **E) Trojan Horse** | Relatable scene, Escalation, Reframe, Demo, Button | Introducing paradigm shifts; getting skeptics to accept new frameworks | Audiences already bought in; technical deep-dives |
| **F) Hero's Journey** | Call, Threshold, Trials, Ordeal, Return | Origin stories; case studies of transformation; founder narratives | Quick updates; data-heavy reports; skeptical technical audiences |
| **G) Freytag's Five-Act** | Exposition, Rising, Climax, Falling, Denouement | Complex narratives with clear build; dramatic/emotional content; keynotes needing catharsis | Fast-paced business contexts; impatient audiences |
| **H) Columbo/Whydunit** | Outcome first, Methodical rebuild, Telltale, Howdunit | Post-mortems; root cause analyses; retrospectives | Forward-looking strategy; audiences who don't know the outcome |
| **I) Game of the Scene** | Base reality, Unusual thing, Name the game, Heighten x3 | Pattern recognition; "hidden dynamics" reveals; cross-domain insight transfer; training | Straightforward how-to content; audiences wanting direct answers |
| **J) Rashomon** | Multi-view, Missing axis, Synthesis | Controversial topics; multi-stakeholder situations; synthesis presentations | Single-perspective content; topics with clear right answers |

## Engagement Arcs vs. Efficiency Frameworks

| Dimension | 10 Narrative Arcs (A-J) | Communication Frameworks (Pyramid, AIDA, etc.) |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary goal** | Engagement through mystery, revelation, reframe | Efficiency, clarity, persuasion |
| **Information flow** | Delayed reveal; strategic withholding | Answer-first or linear progression |
| **Audience posture** | Active puzzle-solving; curiosity-driven | Passive reception; decision-focused |
| **Emotional peak** | Built toward ~55-65% (the reveal) | Varies (end for AIDA, start for Pyramid) |
| **Best for** | Thought leadership, keynotes, complex ideas | Sales, executive updates, training |
| **Risk** | Frustrates time-pressed audiences | Can feel flat or predictable |

## Hybrid Combinations

When two frameworks fit equally well:

| Hybrid | When to Use | How to Combine |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Pyramid + Prestige** | Exec audience + material has twist | Answer-first, evidence as "Turn" |
| **Heist + Columbo** | Strategy explaining past success | Goal --> how crew achieved it |
| **Trojan Horse + Rashomon** | Controversial reframe | Multiple views --> reveal missing axis |
| **Time Machine + Heist** | Strategic planning + execution | Future-back --> "crew assembly" |
| **Mystery Box + Pyramid** | Research for execs | SCQA mystery hook --> Pyramid body |
| **Hero's Journey + Game of Scene** | Case study + pattern insight | Transformation --> "name the game" |
| **Freytag + Story Circle** | Change management with high drama | Five-act dramatic structure + audience-as-hero |
| **Game of Scene + Schwartz Awareness** | Training for mixed-awareness audience | Name the hidden pattern + calibrate to awareness level |

---

## The Reveal Question

**Does the material contain a genuine surprise, counterintuitive finding, or reframe?**

| Answer | Framework Direction |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Yes -- clear surprise** | Engagement arcs: Prestige, Mystery Box, Trojan Horse |
| **Yes -- transformation** | Hero's Journey, Game of Scene, Freytag |
| **Yes -- dramatic emotional stakes** | Freytag, Hero's Journey + Vonnegut Shapes |
| **No -- straightforward** | Efficiency frameworks: Pyramid, AIDA, Columbo |
| **Uncertain** | Analyze for hidden patterns; often Game of Scene can surface them |

If forcing an engagement arc on material without genuine surprise, the reveal will feel manufactured. Better to use efficiency frameworks that deliver value directly.

---

## Framework vs. Arc: When to Use Which

### Use Narrative Arcs (A-J) When:
- Audience has time and attention
- Material contains genuine surprise or transformation
- Goal is thought leadership or paradigm shift
- Keynote or conference setting
- Building long-term influence over immediate action

### Use Communication Frameworks When:
- Audience is time-constrained
- Material is straightforward information delivery
- Goal is immediate decision or action
- Executive or board setting
- Clarity more important than engagement

### Use Hybrid When:
- Exec audience but material has surprise (Pyramid + Prestige)
- Need to persuade skeptics with data (Trojan Horse + Evidence)
- Multi-stakeholder alignment with action needed (Rashomon + Pyramid)
- Training with dramatic stakes (Freytag + Story Circle)
- Pattern recognition for mixed-awareness groups (Game of Scene + Schwartz Awareness)

---

## Cognitive Considerations

Always apply regardless of framework:

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Working memory limit** | 3-5 items max per concept |
| **Peak-end rule** | Design one peak; craft strong ending |
| **Primacy effect** | Core thesis in opening |
| **Recency effect** | CTA and summary at close |
| **Dual coding** | Complementary (not redundant) visual + verbal |
| **3-second rule** | Slides are glance media; simplify |

---

## Persuasion Overlay Checklist

Layer onto any framework:

- [ ] **Reciprocity:** Do we give value before asking?
- [ ] **Commitment:** Are there micro-agreements building?
- [ ] **Social Proof:** Are examples relatable to THIS audience?
- [ ] **Authority:** Are credentials and sources clear?
- [ ] **Liking:** Is there common ground and "we" language?
- [ ] **Scarcity:** Is cost of inaction clear?
- [ ] **Unity:** Does this feel like "us" not "us vs. them"?
