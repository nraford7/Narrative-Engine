    ↓
PHASE 2     Discovery Questions — Audience, purpose, content type, tone
    ↓
PHASE 2.5   Density Mode — Varies by output format
    ↓
PHASE 3     Framework Recommendation — Full sweep + dark horse
    ↓
PHASE 3.5   Build Brief — Translates ALL discovery into concrete writing instructions
    ↓
PHASE 4     Build — Guided by Build Brief, voice profile, emotional arc
    ↓
PHASE 4.5   Originality Check — Anti-sameness sweep before review
    ↓
PHASE 5     Review Panel — 6 specialist agents (now includes Originality Agent)
    ↓
PHASE 5.5   Stress Test Panel — Optional, auto-selected personas
    ↓
ON-DEMAND   "Tighter" — Compression passes anytime
```

## PHASE 1: Content Import

Accept content in any form:
- Pasted prose, articles, or reports
- Outlines or bullet points
- Research notes or data
- Existing presentation text
- URLs (fetch and extract)

If user pastes content without instructions, acknowledge receipt and proceed to Output Format.

---

## PHASE 1.5: Output Format

Ask before proceeding to focal discovery:

> **What format do you need?**
> 1. **Presentation** — Slide deck with headlines, spotlights, and design notes
> 2. **Prose** — Long-form document with sections, transitions, and flow
> 3. **Both** — Build one, derive the other (specify which first)

### If Prose selected:

Ask for target length:

> **Target length?**
> 1. **Short** (~500-800 words) — Tight, punchy, every sentence earns its place
> 2. **Medium** (~1,000-1,500 words) — Room to develop ideas, standard article length
> 3. **Long** (~2,000-3,000 words) — Comprehensive, detailed, thought leadership depth
> 4. **Let content determine** — No artificial target

### If Both selected:

> **Which format first?**
> 1. **Prose → Presentation** — Write the full narrative, then compress to slides
> 2. **Presentation → Prose** — Build the deck structure, then expand to prose

**Note:** The frameworks (Trojan Horse, Heist, Time Machine, etc.) are *narrative structures* — they work for both formats. The divergence happens at the Build phase.

---

## PHASE 1.75: Focal Discovery

**Purpose:** Establish the single point before anything else.

Read the content and propose 2-3 possible focal points:

> "Based on your material, I see these possible angles:
> 1. **[Angle A]** — [Why this could be the point]
> 2. **[Angle B]** — [Why this could be the point]
> 3. **[Angle C]** — [Why this could be the point]
>
> Which direction should we optimize for? Or is there a different point you want to land?"

**Skip if:** User already explicitly stated their point.

**Output:** A Focal Statement (1-2 sentences) that becomes the north star.

The Focal Statement has three components:
- **The One Thing:** Single idea the piece must land
- **The Ask:** Action or shift being driven toward
- **The Through-Line:** Logical/emotional thread connecting everything

---

## PHASE 2: Discovery Questions

Ask one question at a time. Wait for the user to answer before asking the next question. User can respond with numbers or their own words.

### Question 1: Audience

> **Who is your audience?**
> 1. Executive / Board (time-constrained decision-makers)
> 2. Technical / Engineering (methodology-focused, skeptical)
> 3. Sales / Marketing (action-oriented, competitive)
> 4. Investors / VCs (seeking growth story + traction)
> 5. General Public / Keynote (broad, need accessibility)
> 6. Skeptics / Resisters (need to be won over)
> 7. Mixed / Cross-functional (varied expertise levels)
> 8. Academic / Research (evidence-focused)

### Question 2: Purpose

> **What are you trying to accomplish?**
> 1. Persuade to act (get approval, close a deal)
> 2. Inform / Educate (transfer knowledge)
> 3. Inspire / Motivate (energize, create vision)
> 4. Align / Build consensus (get buy-in)
> 5. Report / Update (share status, results)
> 6. Defend / Justify (support a position)
> 7. Entertain / Engage (keynote, thought leadership)

### Question 3: Content Type

> **What type of content is this?**
> 1. Counterintuitive research findings
> 2. Strategic plan / transformation roadmap
> 3. Scenario planning / decision fork
> 4. Paradigm shift / new mental model
> 5. Company/product origin story
> 6. Post-mortem / retrospective
> 7. Sales pitch
> 8. Investor pitch / fundraising
> 9. Product launch
> 10. Case study
> 11. Policy recommendation
> 12. Vision/inspiration piece

### Question 4: Tone

> **What tone or attitude do you want?**
> 1. Authoritative / Expert
> 2. Provocative / Challenging
> 3. Warm / Relatable
> 4. Urgent / Action-oriented
> 5. Balanced / Objective
> 6. Visionary / Aspirational
> 7. Playful / Creative

---

## PHASE 2.5: Density Mode Selection

### For Presentations:

> **How concentrated should this deck be?**
>
> 1. **High-Impact** — Maximum compression. One punch per slide. Headlines do heavy lifting. For pitches and time-constrained execs.
>
> 2. **Narrative** — Room to breathe. Story beats get space to land. Emotional builds allowed. For thought leadership and teaching.
>
> 3. **Evidence** — Denser supporting material. Multiple proof points per section. For skeptics, technical audiences, due diligence.
>
> 4. **ELI5** — Explain Like I'm 5. Maximum accessibility. Simple words, concrete analogies, zero jargon. For non-experts, broad audiences, or when clarity trumps sophistication.

### For Prose:

> **How should this piece read?**
>
> 1. **Punchy** — Short paragraphs. High signal density. Every sentence earns its place. Hemingway, not Faulkner.
>
> 2. **Flowing** — Room to breathe. Narrative builds allowed. Transitions smooth the ride. Story beats get space to land.
>
> 3. **Dense** — Detailed and thorough. Evidence-heavy. Multiple proof points per section. For readers who want depth.
>
> 4. **ELI5** — Explain Like I'm 5. Simple words, everyday analogies, short sentences. No jargon, no abstractions. Like explaining to a curious child or smart non-expert.

**Key principle:** No minimum word/slide counts. Content determines length.

---

### ELI5 Mode Guidelines

When ELI5 is selected, apply these rules throughout:

**Language Rules:**
- Use common words (≤2 syllables when possible)
- Replace jargon with plain language or define it immediately
- Prefer active voice: "X does Y" not "Y is done by X"
- Maximum sentence length: ~15 words
- One idea per sentence

**Analogy Requirements:**
- Every abstract concept gets a concrete analogy
- Draw from everyday experience: kitchen, playground, family, sports, weather
- "It's like..." should appear frequently
- Test: Would a smart 10-year-old understand this?

**Structure Rules:**
- Shorter paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- More frequent section breaks
- Use questions as headers when helpful ("So what does that mean?")
- Build from familiar → unfamiliar

**What to Avoid:**
- Industry jargon (or define immediately if unavoidable)
- Acronyms without expansion
- Abstract nouns (transformation → change, optimization → making better)
- Passive constructions
- Compound sentences with multiple clauses
- Assuming prior knowledge

**Examples:**

| Instead of... | Write... |
|---------------|----------|
| "Leverage synergies across verticals" | "Use what works in one area to help another" |
| "The algorithm optimizes for engagement" | "The system figures out what keeps people interested" |
| "Market volatility impacts portfolio allocation" | "When prices jump around, you might want to spread your money differently" |
| "Stakeholder alignment is critical" | "Everyone involved needs to agree on what we're doing" |

**Framework Adjustment:**
In ELI5 mode, simpler narrative arcs work better:
- **Hero's Journey** — natural story shape everyone recognizes
- **Columbo** — answer-first keeps people oriented
- **Trojan Horse** — start where they are, guide to insight
- Avoid: Mystery Box (requires patience), Rashomon (requires holding multiple views)

---

## PHASE 3: Framework Recommendation

Based on discovery answers, recommend frameworks using the Full Sweep Protocol.

**REQUIRED:** Before recommending, complete the framework scoring sweep in [`framework-selection.md`](framework-selection.md). This means:
1. Score all 10 narrative arcs (1-5) against this specific combination of inputs
2. Score the top 5 communication frameworks
3. Present the top 2 arc + framework pairings with skeleton and tradeoffs
4. Present 1 Dark Horse — an unexpected option that scores 3+ and could produce something more original
5. Include a Rejection Log — 1-2 sentences on why low-scoring options don't fit

For each recommendation:
1. **Name the framework** and category
2. **Explain fit** in 2-3 sentences specific to their situation
3. **Show the skeleton** — their content mapped to the framework's beats
4. **Flag tradeoffs** — what this framework does well vs. potential drawbacks
5. **Emotional preview** — what the audience will *feel* at the key moments (reference [`emotional-arcs.md`](emotional-arcs.md))

See [`framework-selection.md`](framework-selection.md) for the full sweep protocol and selection matrices.
See [`narrative-arcs.md`](narrative-arcs.md) for arc details including emotional textures.
See [`communication-frameworks.md`](communication-frameworks.md) for framework details.

### High-Stakes Content: Early Agent Review

For these content types, run Audience Advocate and Comms Specialist during framework recommendation:
- Investor pitch / fundraising
- Sales pitch
- Multi-stakeholder / controversial topic
- Policy recommendation
- Strategic plan / transformation

---

## PHASE 3.5: Build Brief

**Purpose:** Translate ALL discovery answers into concrete writing instructions. This is the bridge between "what did the user say" and "how should this be written." Present the Build Brief to the user for confirmation before building.

Generate a Build Brief in this format:

---

### Build Brief

**Focal Statement:** [from Phase 1.75]
**Framework:** [selected in Phase 3] + [communication framework overlay]
**Density:** [from Phase 2.5]

**Voice Profile:** [Auto-derived from audience + tone, or user override]
- See [`voice-profiles.md`](voice-profiles.md) for full profile
- Key instruction: [2-3 sentence summary of the voice's rules]

**Audience Profile:** [from Phase 2]
- See [`audience-profiles.md`](audience-profiles.md) for full profile
- Trust signals to hit: [list 2-3]
- Resistance triggers to avoid: [list 2-3]
- Evidence style: [type]
- Headline style: [specific to this audience]

**Emotional Arc:** [from emotional-arcs.md]
- Shape: [e.g., "comfort → unease → snap → reorientation → urgency"]
- Intensity dial: [1-5, calibrated to audience]
- Key emotional moment: [which beat, how to handle it]

**Persuasion Strategy:** [2-3 Cialdini principles prioritized for this audience]
- Primary: [principle] — apply by [specific instruction]
- Secondary: [principle] — apply by [specific instruction]

**Opening Strategy:** [selected from opening-closing-strategies.md]
- Type: [e.g., Cold Open Scene]
- Combined with framework beat: [e.g., "The Prestige's Pledge beat, delivered as a Cold Open Scene"]

**Closing Strategy:** [selected from opening-closing-strategies.md]
- Type: [e.g., The Simple Truth]
- Combined with framework beat: [e.g., "The Prestige's Callback beat, delivered as The Simple Truth"]

**Killer Line Target:** [Draft 2-3 candidate killer lines based on the focal statement. Refine during build.]

**Anti-Sameness Notes:** [Any specific instructions to avoid generic patterns — e.g., "This audience has seen 100 'digital transformation' decks. Find a fresh angle on slide structure or metaphor."]

---

> "Here's the Build Brief I'll use to guide the output. Anything you'd change before I build?"

The user can adjust any element. Once confirmed, the Build Brief becomes the binding reference for Phase 4.

---

## PHASE 4: Build (Subagent)

The build phase runs as a subagent via the Task tool, offloading the heaviest generation work from the main conversation. Phase 4.5 (Originality Check) is folded into the build subagent as a self-review step.

### Pre-Build: Write Handoff Files

Before dispatching:
1. Write the confirmed Build Brief to `/tmp/ne-build-brief.md`
2. Write the user's source content to `/tmp/ne-source-content.md`

### Dispatch

Create one Task:
- **subagent_type:** `general-purpose`
- **Prompt:** Read and execute [`prompts/builder.md`](prompts/builder.md)
- The subagent reads all reference files specified in the Build Brief (arc, voice, audience, emotional texture, strategies, checklists)
- The subagent runs the Originality & Anti-Sameness Checklist before finalizing (Phase 4.5 folded in)
- Output written to `/tmp/ne-output.md`

### Post-Build

1. Read `/tmp/ne-output.md`
2. Present the complete output to the user
3. Proceed to Phase 5

### Content Sourcing Tags

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `[DIRECT]` | Quoted or nearly verbatim from source |
| `[PARAPHRASE]` | User's ideas restated |
| `[ELABORATED]` | User's concept expanded |
| `[GENERATED]` | New content for narrative flow |

> Full output format templates (Presentation, Prose, Converting Between Formats) are in [`prompts/builder.md`](prompts/builder.md).

---

## PHASE 5: Review Panel (6 Parallel Subagents)

Six specialist agents review the output simultaneously via the Task tool.

```
                    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
                    │            DIRECTOR                 │
                    │  Synthesizes, resolves conflicts    │
                    │        (main conversation)          │
                    └─────────────────────────────────────┘
                                     ▲
        ┌──────┬──────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────┬──────┐
        ▼      ▼      ▼             ▼              ▼      ▼      ▼
   AUDIENCE  COMMS  VISUAL      CRITIC        CONTENT  ORIGINALITY
   ADVOCATE  SPEC   DESIGNER                  EXPERT    AGENT
                    (parallel subagents)
```

### Dispatch

Create 6 Tasks simultaneously using [`prompts/reviewer.md`](prompts/reviewer.md) with these parameters:

| # | Agent | Reference File | Key Question |
|---|-------|----------------|-------------|
| 1 | Audience Advocate | [`audience-profiles.md`](audience-profiles.md) | "As [audience], does this resonate?" |
| 2 | Comms/PR Specialist | [`agent-reference-persuasion.md`](agent-reference-persuasion.md) | "Is the message tight and bulletproof?" |
| 3 | Visual Designer | [`agent-reference-visual.md`](agent-reference-visual.md) | [format-dependent question] |
| 4 | Critic | (none) | "If I had to cut 20%, what goes?" |
| 5 | Content Expert | [`agent-reference-verification.md`](agent-reference-verification.md) | "Can every claim be defended?" |
| 6 | Originality Agent | [`checklists.md`](checklists.md) | "Would this be distinguishable from any other AI piece?" |

Each subagent:
- **subagent_type:** `general-purpose`
- Reads `/tmp/ne-output.md` and `/tmp/ne-build-brief.md` plus its reference file
- Returns findings as task result (not written to file)

See [`prompts/reviewer.md`](prompts/reviewer.md) for full role descriptions and dispatch configurations.

### Director Synthesis (Main Conversation)

After all 6 complete, synthesize into unified recommendations:

1. **Consensus items** — Multiple agents agree → high-confidence recommendation
2. **Minor conflicts** — Director decides based on audience/purpose
3. **Strong conflicts** — Escalate to user for decision

**Output format:**

```markdown
## Review Panel Synthesis

### Strengths
- [What's working] — *Agent attribution*

### Recommended Changes
1. **[Change]** — *Agent attribution*
   [Specific recommendation]

### Points Requiring Your Decision
> **Conflict:** [Agent A] says X, [Agent B] says Y
> Which approach? 1. [Option A] 2. [Option B] 3. Keep as-is

### Overall Assessment
**Ready?** [Yes / Yes with edits / Needs revision]
**Most important improvement:** [One sentence]
```

---

## PHASE 5.5: Stress Test Panel (3 Parallel Subagents, Optional)

After Review Panel, offer stress testing:

> "Want me to run the Stress Test Panel? Based on your content type [X], I'd test against: **[Persona 1]**, **[Persona 2]**, **[Persona 3]**.
>
> You can also add or swap: Engineer, Skeptic, Risk Officer, CFO, Lawyer, Conservative, COO.
>
> Run it? (yes / yes, but add X / skip)"

### Auto-Selection by Content Type

| Content Type | Auto-Selected |
|--------------|---------------|
| Investor pitch | CFO, COO, Skeptic |
| Sales pitch | Skeptic, COO, Engineer |
| Strategic plan | COO, Conservative, Risk Officer |
| Technical proposal | Engineer, Skeptic, COO |
| Policy recommendation | Lawyer, Risk Officer, Conservative |
| Product launch | COO, Skeptic, Engineer |
| Post-mortem | Engineer, Risk Officer, COO |
| Keynote | Skeptic, Conservative |

### Dispatch

Create 3 Tasks simultaneously using [`prompts/stress-tester.md`](prompts/stress-tester.md) with the auto-selected persona parameters. Each subagent:
- **subagent_type:** `general-purpose`
- Reads `/tmp/ne-output.md` and `/tmp/ne-build-brief.md`
- Returns PASSED/FLAGGED/FAILED verdict with findings as task result

See [`prompts/stress-tester.md`](prompts/stress-tester.md) for full persona descriptions and configurations.

### Director Triage (Main Conversation)

After personas review, Director categorizes:

```markdown
## Stress Test Results

### [Persona] — [PASSED / FLAGGED / FAILED]
**Concerns:**
1. [Concern]

---

## Director Triage

### 🔴 Must Fix (will undermine piece if ignored)
1. **[Issue]** ([Persona]) — [Why it matters and how to fix]

### 🟡 Should Fix (strengthens meaningfully)
1. **[Issue]** ([Persona]) — [Recommendation]

### 🟢 Could Fix (nice-to-have)
1. **[Issue]** ([Persona]) — [Optional improvement]

### Director's Recommendation
[1-2 sentences on what to prioritize]
```

---

## ON-DEMAND: "Tighter"

User can request compression passes anytime after delivery.

When user says "tighter":

1. **Focal check** — Has the point drifted? Re-confirm.
2. **Section pass** — Any sections that could merge or be cut?
3. **Unit pass** — Four-lens compression on every slide/paragraph.
4. **Output** — Tighter version with change summary.

Repeatable until user is satisfied.

---

## ON-DEMAND: Change Log Export

After final delivery (or after any revision pass), offer to export a Change Log:

> "Want me to export a Change Log? This documents what changed from your original content and why — useful for collaborators, future reference, or understanding the transformation."

See [`checklists.md`](checklists.md) for the Change Log template and Metric Menu.

---
