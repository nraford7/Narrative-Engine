## PHASE 1: Content Import

Accept content in any form:
- Pasted prose, articles, or reports
- Outlines or bullet points
- Research notes or data
- Existing presentation text
- URLs (fetch and extract)

If user pastes content without instructions, acknowledge receipt and proceed to Focal Discovery.

---

## PHASE 1.5: Focal Discovery

**Purpose:** Establish the single point of the deck before anything else.

Read the content and propose 2-3 possible focal points:

> "Based on your material, I see these possible angles:
> 1. **[Angle A]** — [Why this could be the point]
> 2. **[Angle B]** — [Why this could be the point]
> 3. **[Angle C]** — [Why this could be the point]
>
> Which direction should we optimize for? Or is there a different point you want to land?"

**Skip if:** User already explicitly stated their point.

**Output:** A Focal Statement (1-2 sentences) that becomes the north star.

The Focal Statement has three components:
- **The One Thing:** Single idea the deck must land
- **The Ask:** Action or shift being driven toward
- **The Through-Line:** Logical/emotional thread connecting everything

---

## PHASE 2: Discovery Questions

Ask one question at a time. Wait for the user to answer before asking the next question. User can respond with numbers or their own words.

### Question 1: Audience

> **Who is your audience?**
> 1. Executive / Board (time-constrained decision-makers)
> 2. Technical / Engineering (methodology-focused, skeptical)
> 3. Sales / Marketing (action-oriented, competitive)
> 4. Investors / VCs (seeking growth story + traction)
> 5. General Public / Keynote (broad, need accessibility)
> 6. Skeptics / Resisters (need to be won over)
> 7. Mixed / Cross-functional (varied expertise levels)
> 8. Academic / Research (evidence-focused)

### Question 2: Purpose

> **What are you trying to accomplish?**
> 1. Persuade to act (get approval, close a deal)
> 2. Inform / Educate (transfer knowledge)
> 3. Inspire / Motivate (energize, create vision)
> 4. Align / Build consensus (get buy-in)
> 5. Report / Update (share status, results)
> 6. Defend / Justify (support a position)
> 7. Entertain / Engage (keynote, thought leadership)

### Question 3: Content Type

> **What type of content is this?**
> 1. Counterintuitive research findings
> 2. Strategic plan / transformation roadmap
> 3. Scenario planning / decision fork
> 4. Paradigm shift / new mental model
> 5. Company/product origin story
> 6. Post-mortem / retrospective
> 7. Sales pitch
> 8. Investor pitch / fundraising
> 9. Product launch
> 10. Case study
> 11. Policy recommendation
> 12. Vision/inspiration piece

### Question 4: Tone

> **What tone or attitude do you want?**
> 1. Authoritative / Expert
> 2. Provocative / Challenging
> 3. Warm / Relatable
> 4. Urgent / Action-oriented
> 5. Balanced / Objective
> 6. Visionary / Aspirational
> 7. Playful / Creative

---

## PHASE 2.5: Density Mode Selection

> **How concentrated should this deck be?**
>
> 1. **High-Impact** — Maximum compression. One punch per slide. Headlines do heavy lifting. For pitches and time-constrained execs.
>
> 2. **Narrative** — Room to breathe. Story beats get space to land. Emotional builds allowed. For thought leadership and teaching.
>
> 3. **Evidence** — Denser supporting material. Multiple proof points per section. For skeptics, technical audiences, due diligence.

**Key principle:** No minimum slide counts. Content determines length.

---

## PHASE 3: Framework Recommendation

Based on discovery answers, recommend 2-3 frameworks.

For each recommendation:
1. **Name the framework** and category (Narrative Arc vs. Communication Framework)
2. **Explain fit** in 2-3 sentences specific to their situation
3. **Show the skeleton** — their content mapped to the framework's beats
4. **Flag tradeoffs** — what this framework does well vs. potential drawbacks

See [`framework-selection.md`](framework-selection.md) for selection matrix.
See [`narrative-arcs.md`](narrative-arcs.md) for arc details.
See [`communication-frameworks.md`](communication-frameworks.md) for framework details.

### Quick Selection Heuristics

| If... | Consider... |
|-------|-------------|
| Executive audience | Columbo or Pyramid — answer-first |
| Skeptical audience | Trojan Horse — meet them where they are |
| Material has genuine surprise | The Prestige or Mystery Box |
| Strategy/transformation | The Heist — goal-obstacles-crew |
| Vision/future focus | Time Machine — future-back |
| Origin story | Hero's Journey — transformation |
| Multi-stakeholder | Rashomon — multiple views to synthesis |
| Post-mortem | Columbo — outcome-first reconstruction |

### High-Stakes Content: Early Agent Review

For these content types, run Audience Advocate and Comms Specialist during framework recommendation:
- Investor pitch / fundraising
- Sales pitch
- Multi-stakeholder / controversial topic
- Policy recommendation
- Strategic plan / transformation

---

## PHASE 4: Build

Generate the deck with integrated compression. Every slide must justify its existence.

### Three-Level Clarity System

**Level 1: Focal Agent (Deck Level)**
- Does every section trace back to the Focal Statement?
- Is the through-line clear?

**Level 2: Section Clarity Agent**
- Does this section advance the point, or is it a detour?
- Could two sections merge without losing anything?
- Is the section's role clear? (Setup? Evidence? Turn? Resolution?)

**Level 3: Slide Compression Agent**
Four lenses on every slide:

| Lens | Question | Kill If... |
|------|----------|------------|
| **Structure** | If removed, would deck still work? | Redundant, padding |
| **Language** | Can this be said in fewer words? | Jargon, filler, bloat |
| **Clarity** | Grasped in 3 seconds? | Convoluted, unclear |
| **So What** | Why should audience care? | Empty, no benefit |

**Protected Species (do NOT cut):**
- Vivid metaphors that create memorability
- Emotional beats that build connection
- The surprising turn / reveal moment
- Specific details that make abstract concrete
- Callbacks and plants that pay off later

### Slide Format

Each slide contains:
- **Headline:** Single sentence, ≤14 words, active voice
- **Spotlight:** ≤60 words — ONE example, statistic, or quote (with citation)
- **Design note:** ONE specific visual suggestion
- **Source tag:** [DIRECT] / [PARAPHRASE] / [ELABORATED] / [GENERATED]

### Headline Rules

- **Image & Action:** Concrete actors + strong verbs; avoid "is/are"
- **Tension & Turn:** Because/Therefore, Not/But, Before/After
- **Cadence:** 8-14 words; favor two-beat rhythm
- **Specific Anchors:** Name time/place/actor/number in every third headline
- **One metaphor family** across the deck (journey OR weather OR architecture, etc.)

See [`checklists.md`](checklists.md) for headline banlist and quality sweeps.
See [`agent-reference-persuasion.md`](agent-reference-persuasion.md) for verbalization techniques.

### Content Sourcing Tags

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `[DIRECT]` | Quoted or nearly verbatim from source |
| `[PARAPHRASE]` | User's ideas restated |
| `[ELABORATED]` | User's concept expanded |
| `[GENERATED]` | New content for narrative flow |

Include Sourcing Summary at end of deck.

### Output Format

```markdown
# [Deck Title]

**Framework:** [Name]
**Density:** [High-Impact / Narrative / Evidence]
**Focal Statement:** [The one point]
**Metaphor family:** [chosen metaphor]

---

## Slide 1 — [Section/Beat Name]

```

---

## PHASE 5: Review Panel

Five specialist agents review the deck in parallel.

```
                    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
                    │            DIRECTOR                 │
                    │  Synthesizes, resolves conflicts    │
                    └─────────────────────────────────────┘
                                     ▲
        ┌────────────┬───────────────┼───────────────┬────────────┐
        ▼            ▼               ▼               ▼            ▼
   AUDIENCE     COMMS/PR        VISUAL         CRITIC       CONTENT
   ADVOCATE     SPECIALIST      DESIGNER                    EXPERT
```

### Agent Roles

**Audience Advocate** — Reviews as the target audience. Flags what won't land.
- Reference: Audience profile from Phase 2
- Key question: "As [audience], does this resonate? What makes me skeptical?"

**Comms/PR Specialist** — Reviews for messaging, emotion, persuasion.
- Reference: [`agent-reference-persuasion.md`](agent-reference-persuasion.md)
- Key question: "Is the message tight, emotionally resonant, and bulletproof?"

**Visual Designer** — Reviews design notes, upgrades visual metaphors.
- Reference: [`agent-reference-visual.md`](agent-reference-visual.md)
- Key question: "What visual would make the key slide unforgettable?"

**Critic** — Reviews for pacing, redundancy, weak links.
- Key question: "If I had to cut 20%, what goes? What's the weakest link?"
- Runs Perplexity search for counterarguments and opposing viewpoints.

**Content Expert** — Reviews for accuracy, sourcing, logical validity.
- Reference: [`agent-reference-verification.md`](agent-reference-verification.md)
- Key question: "Can every claim be defended if challenged?"
- Runs Perplexity search for supporting evidence.

### Director Synthesis

Integrates all feedback into unified recommendations:

1. **Consensus items** — Multiple agents agree → high-confidence recommendation
2. **Minor conflicts** — Director decides based on audience/purpose
3. **Strong conflicts** — Escalate to user for decision

**Output format:**

```markdown
## Review Panel Synthesis

### Strengths
- [What's working] — *Agent attribution*

### Recommended Changes
1. **[Change]** — *Agent attribution*
   [Specific recommendation]

### Points Requiring Your Decision
> **Conflict:** [Agent A] says X, [Agent B] says Y
> Which approach? 1. [Option A] 2. [Option B] 3. Keep as-is

### Overall Assessment
**Ready?** [Yes / Yes with edits / Needs revision]
**Most important improvement:** [One sentence]
```

---

## PHASE 5.5: Stress Test Panel (Optional)

After Review Panel, offer stress testing:

> "Want me to run the Stress Test Panel? Based on your content type [X], I'd test against: **[Persona 1]**, **[Persona 2]**, **[Persona 3]**.
>
> You can also add or swap: Engineer, Skeptic, Risk Officer, CFO, Lawyer, Conservative, COO.
>
> Run it? (yes / yes, but add X / skip)"

### 7 Stress Test Personas

| Persona | Lens | What They Catch |
|---------|------|-----------------|
| **Engineer** | "How does this actually work?" | Hand-wavy claims, logical gaps |
| **Skeptic** | "Why should I believe this?" | Weak proof, confirmation bias |
| **Risk Officer** | "What could go wrong?" | Missing caveats, overconfidence |
| **CFO** | "What are the numbers?" | Fuzzy math, unclear ROI |
| **Lawyer** | "What's the exposure?" | Overpromises, liability |
| **Conservative** | "Why change what's working?" | Unaddressed status-quo concerns |
| **COO** | "Would this actually work?" | Operational blindspots, unrealistic execution |

### Auto-Selection by Content Type

| Content Type | Auto-Selected |
|--------------|---------------|
| Investor pitch | CFO, COO, Skeptic |
| Sales pitch | Skeptic, COO, Engineer |
| Strategic plan | COO, Conservative, Risk Officer |
| Technical proposal | Engineer, Skeptic, COO |
| Policy recommendation | Lawyer, Risk Officer, Conservative |
| Product launch | COO, Skeptic, Engineer |
| Post-mortem | Engineer, Risk Officer, COO |
| Keynote | Skeptic, Conservative |

### Director Triage

After personas review, Director categorizes:

```markdown
## Stress Test Results

### [Persona] — [PASSED / FLAGGED / FAILED]
**Concerns:**
1. [Concern]

---

## Director Triage

### 🔴 Must Fix (will undermine deck if ignored)
1. **[Issue]** ([Persona]) — [Why it matters and how to fix]

### 🟡 Should Fix (strengthens meaningfully)
1. **[Issue]** ([Persona]) — [Recommendation]

### 🟢 Could Fix (nice-to-have)
1. **[Issue]** ([Persona]) — [Optional improvement]

### Director's Recommendation
[1-2 sentences on what to prioritize]
```

---

## ON-DEMAND: "Tighter"

User can request compression passes anytime after delivery.

When user says "tighter":

1. **Focal check** — Has the point drifted? Re-confirm.
2. **Section pass** — Any sections that could merge or be cut?
3. **Slide pass** — Four-lens compression on every slide.
4. **Output** — Tighter version with change summary.

Repeatable until user is satisfied.
