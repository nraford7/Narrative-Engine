PHASE 2     Discovery Questions — Audience, purpose, content type, tone
    ↓
PHASE 2.5   Density Mode — Varies by output format
    ↓
PHASE 3     Framework Recommendation — Full sweep + dark horse
    ↓
PHASE 3.5   Build Brief — Translates ALL discovery into concrete writing instructions
    ↓

## PHASE 1: Content Import

Accept content in any form:
- Pasted prose, articles, or reports
- Outlines or bullet points
- Research notes or data
- Existing presentation text
- URLs (fetch and extract)

If user pastes content without instructions, acknowledge receipt and proceed to Output Format.

---

## PHASE 1.5: Output Format

Ask before proceeding to focal discovery:

> **What format do you need?**
> 1. **Presentation** — Slide deck with headlines, spotlights, and design notes
> 2. **Prose** — Long-form document with sections, transitions, and flow
> 3. **Both** — Build one, derive the other (specify which first)

### If Prose selected:

Ask for target length:

> **Target length?**
> 1. **Short** (~500-800 words) — Tight, punchy, every sentence earns its place
> 2. **Medium** (~1,000-1,500 words) — Room to develop ideas, standard article length
> 3. **Long** (~2,000-3,000 words) — Comprehensive, detailed, thought leadership depth
> 4. **Let content determine** — No artificial target

### If Both selected:

> **Which format first?**
> 1. **Prose → Presentation** — Write the full narrative, then compress to slides
> 2. **Presentation → Prose** — Build the deck structure, then expand to prose

**Note:** The frameworks (Trojan Horse, Heist, Time Machine, etc.) are *narrative structures* — they work for both formats. The divergence happens at the Build phase.

---

## PHASE 1.75: Focal Discovery

**Purpose:** Establish the single point before anything else.

Read the content and propose 2-3 possible focal points:

> "Based on your material, I see these possible angles:
> 1. **[Angle A]** — [Why this could be the point]
> 2. **[Angle B]** — [Why this could be the point]
> 3. **[Angle C]** — [Why this could be the point]
>
> Which direction should we optimize for? Or is there a different point you want to land?"

**Skip if:** User already explicitly stated their point.

**Output:** A Focal Statement (1-2 sentences) that becomes the north star.

The Focal Statement has three components:
- **The One Thing:** Single idea the piece must land
- **The Ask:** Action or shift being driven toward
- **The Through-Line:** Logical/emotional thread connecting everything

---

## PHASE 2: Discovery Questions

Ask one question at a time. Wait for the user to answer before asking the next question. User can respond with numbers or their own words.

### Question 1: Audience

> **Who is your audience?**
> 1. Executive / Board (time-constrained decision-makers)
> 2. Technical / Engineering (methodology-focused, skeptical)
> 3. Sales / Marketing (action-oriented, competitive)
> 4. Investors / VCs (seeking growth story + traction)
> 5. General Public / Keynote (broad, need accessibility)
> 6. Skeptics / Resisters (need to be won over)
> 7. Mixed / Cross-functional (varied expertise levels)
> 8. Academic / Research (evidence-focused)

### Question 2: Purpose

> **What are you trying to accomplish?**
> 1. Persuade to act (get approval, close a deal)
> 2. Inform / Educate (transfer knowledge)
> 3. Inspire / Motivate (energize, create vision)
> 4. Align / Build consensus (get buy-in)
> 5. Report / Update (share status, results)
> 6. Defend / Justify (support a position)
> 7. Entertain / Engage (keynote, thought leadership)

### Question 3: Content Type

> **What type of content is this?**
> 1. Counterintuitive research findings
> 2. Strategic plan / transformation roadmap
> 3. Scenario planning / decision fork
> 4. Paradigm shift / new mental model
> 5. Company/product origin story
> 6. Post-mortem / retrospective
> 7. Sales pitch
> 8. Investor pitch / fundraising
> 9. Product launch
> 10. Case study
> 11. Policy recommendation
> 12. Vision/inspiration piece

### Question 4: Tone

> **What tone or attitude do you want?**
> 1. Authoritative / Expert
> 2. Provocative / Challenging
> 3. Warm / Relatable
> 4. Urgent / Action-oriented
> 5. Balanced / Objective
> 6. Visionary / Aspirational
> 7. Playful / Creative

---

## PHASE 2.5: Density Mode Selection

### For Presentations:

> **How concentrated should this deck be?**
>
> 1. **High-Impact** — Maximum compression. One punch per slide. Headlines do heavy lifting. For pitches and time-constrained execs.
>
> 2. **Narrative** — Room to breathe. Story beats get space to land. Emotional builds allowed. For thought leadership and teaching.
>
> 3. **Evidence** — Denser supporting material. Multiple proof points per section. For skeptics, technical audiences, due diligence.
>
> 4. **ELI5** — Explain Like I'm 5. Maximum accessibility. Simple words, concrete analogies, zero jargon. For non-experts, broad audiences, or when clarity trumps sophistication.

### For Prose:

> **How should this piece read?**
>
> 1. **Punchy** — Short paragraphs. High signal density. Every sentence earns its place. Hemingway, not Faulkner.
>
> 2. **Flowing** — Room to breathe. Narrative builds allowed. Transitions smooth the ride. Story beats get space to land.
>
> 3. **Dense** — Detailed and thorough. Evidence-heavy. Multiple proof points per section. For readers who want depth.
>
> 4. **ELI5** — Explain Like I'm 5. Simple words, everyday analogies, short sentences. No jargon, no abstractions. Like explaining to a curious child or smart non-expert.

**Key principle:** No minimum word/slide counts. Content determines length.

---

### ELI5 Mode Guidelines

When ELI5 is selected, apply these rules throughout:

**Language Rules:**
- Use common words (≤2 syllables when possible)
- Replace jargon with plain language or define it immediately
- Prefer active voice: "X does Y" not "Y is done by X"
- Maximum sentence length: ~15 words
- One idea per sentence

**Analogy Requirements:**
- Every abstract concept gets a concrete analogy
- Draw from everyday experience: kitchen, playground, family, sports, weather
- "It's like..." should appear frequently
- Test: Would a smart 10-year-old understand this?

**Structure Rules:**
- Shorter paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- More frequent section breaks
- Use questions as headers when helpful ("So what does that mean?")
- Build from familiar → unfamiliar

**What to Avoid:**
- Industry jargon (or define immediately if unavoidable)
- Acronyms without expansion
- Abstract nouns (transformation → change, optimization → making better)
- Passive constructions
- Compound sentences with multiple clauses
- Assuming prior knowledge

**Examples:**

| Instead of... | Write... |
|---------------|----------|
| "Leverage synergies across verticals" | "Use what works in one area to help another" |
| "The algorithm optimizes for engagement" | "The system figures out what keeps people interested" |
| "Market volatility impacts portfolio allocation" | "When prices jump around, you might want to spread your money differently" |
| "Stakeholder alignment is critical" | "Everyone involved needs to agree on what we're doing" |

**Framework Adjustment:**
In ELI5 mode, simpler narrative arcs work better:
- **Hero's Journey** — natural story shape everyone recognizes
- **Columbo** — answer-first keeps people oriented
- **Trojan Horse** — start where they are, guide to insight
- Avoid: Mystery Box (requires patience), Rashomon (requires holding multiple views)

---

## PHASE 3: Framework Recommendation

Based on discovery answers, recommend frameworks using the Full Sweep Protocol.

**REQUIRED:** Before recommending, complete the framework scoring sweep in [`framework-selection.md`](framework-selection.md). This means:
1. Score all 10 narrative arcs (1-5) against this specific combination of inputs
2. Score the top 5 communication frameworks
3. Present the top 2 arc + framework pairings with skeleton and tradeoffs
4. Present 1 Dark Horse — an unexpected option that scores 3+ and could produce something more original
5. Include a Rejection Log — 1-2 sentences on why low-scoring options don't fit

For each recommendation:
1. **Name the framework** and category
2. **Explain fit** in 2-3 sentences specific to their situation
3. **Show the skeleton** — their content mapped to the framework's beats
4. **Flag tradeoffs** — what this framework does well vs. potential drawbacks
5. **Emotional preview** — what the audience will *feel* at the key moments (reference [`emotional-arcs.md`](emotional-arcs.md))

See [`framework-selection.md`](framework-selection.md) for the full sweep protocol and selection matrices.
See [`narrative-arcs.md`](narrative-arcs.md) for arc details including emotional textures.
See [`communication-frameworks.md`](communication-frameworks.md) for framework details.

### High-Stakes Content: Early Agent Review

For these content types, run Audience Advocate and Comms Specialist during framework recommendation:
- Investor pitch / fundraising
- Sales pitch
- Multi-stakeholder / controversial topic
- Policy recommendation
- Strategic plan / transformation

---

## PHASE 3.5: Build Brief

**Purpose:** Translate ALL discovery answers into concrete writing instructions. This is the bridge between "what did the user say" and "how should this be written." Present the Build Brief to the user for confirmation before building.

Generate a Build Brief in this format:

---

### Build Brief

**Focal Statement:** [from Phase 1.75]
**Framework:** [selected in Phase 3] + [communication framework overlay]
**Density:** [from Phase 2.5]

**Voice Profile:** [Auto-derived from audience + tone, or user override]
- See [`voice-profiles.md`](voice-profiles.md) for full profile
- Key instruction: [2-3 sentence summary of the voice's rules]

**Audience Profile:** [from Phase 2]
- See [`audience-profiles.md`](audience-profiles.md) for full profile
- Trust signals to hit: [list 2-3]
- Resistance triggers to avoid: [list 2-3]
- Evidence style: [type]
- Headline style: [specific to this audience]

**Emotional Arc:** [from emotional-arcs.md]
- Shape: [e.g., "comfort → unease → snap → reorientation → urgency"]
- Intensity dial: [1-5, calibrated to audience]
- Key emotional moment: [which beat, how to handle it]

**Persuasion Strategy:** [2-3 Cialdini principles prioritized for this audience]
- Primary: [principle] — apply by [specific instruction]
- Secondary: [principle] — apply by [specific instruction]

**Opening Strategy:** [selected from opening-closing-strategies.md]
- Type: [e.g., Cold Open Scene]
- Combined with framework beat: [e.g., "The Prestige's Pledge beat, delivered as a Cold Open Scene"]

**Closing Strategy:** [selected from opening-closing-strategies.md]
- Type: [e.g., The Simple Truth]
- Combined with framework beat: [e.g., "The Prestige's Callback beat, delivered as The Simple Truth"]

**Killer Line Target:** [Draft 2-3 candidate killer lines based on the focal statement. Refine during build.]

**Anti-Sameness Notes:** [Any specific instructions to avoid generic patterns — e.g., "This audience has seen 100 'digital transformation' decks. Find a fresh angle on slide structure or metaphor."]

---

> "Here's the Build Brief I'll use to guide the output. Anything you'd change before I build?"

The user can adjust any element. Once confirmed, the Build Brief becomes the binding reference for Phase 4.

---

## PHASE 4: Build

Generate the output guided by the Build Brief. Every decision references the brief — voice, audience, emotional arc, opening/closing, persuasion strategy. The Build Brief is the primary reference; framework beat structure is the secondary reference.

### Three-Level Clarity System

**Level 1: Focal Agent (Piece Level)**
- Does every section trace back to the Focal Statement?
- Is the through-line clear?

**Level 2: Section Clarity Agent**
- Does this section advance the point, or is it a detour?
- Could two sections merge without losing anything?
- Is the section's role clear? (Setup? Evidence? Turn? Resolution?)

**Level 3: Unit Compression Agent**
Four lenses on every slide/paragraph:

| Lens | Question | Kill If... |
|------|----------|------------|
| **Structure** | If removed, would piece still work? | Redundant, padding |
| **Language** | Can this be said in fewer words? | Jargon, filler, bloat |
| **Clarity** | Grasped quickly? | Convoluted, unclear |
| **So What** | Why should audience care? | Empty, no benefit |

**Protected Species (do NOT cut):**
- Vivid metaphors that create memorability
- Emotional beats that build connection
- The surprising turn / reveal moment
- Specific details that make abstract concrete
- Callbacks and plants that pay off later

### Voice Application

Apply the selected voice profile from [`voice-profiles.md`](voice-profiles.md) throughout:
- **Sentence structure** must match the profile's patterns
- **Vocabulary** must stay within the profile's register
- **Paragraph rhythm** must follow the profile's variation pattern
- **Signature moves** should appear at least 2-3 times in the piece

### Emotional Arc Application

Follow the framework's emotional texture from [`emotional-arcs.md`](emotional-arcs.md):
- Map the intended audience emotion to each beat
- Shift language register at the points specified in the arc's texture
- Calibrate intensity to the audience's emotional ceiling
- The key emotional moment gets extra craft — do not rush it

### Killer Line Placement

During the build, identify the Killer Line:
- Refine the candidates from the Build Brief
- Place it at the highest-impact moment
- Tag it with **[KILLER LINE]** in the output
- Verify it passes the tests in [`checklists.md`](checklists.md) Killer Line checklist

---

### PRESENTATION Output Format

Each slide contains:
- **Headline:** Single sentence, ≤14 words, active voice
- **Spotlight:** ≤60 words — ONE example, statistic, or quote (with citation)
- **Design note:** ONE specific visual suggestion
- **Source tag:** [DIRECT] / [PARAPHRASE] / [ELABORATED] / [GENERATED]

#### Headline Rules

- **Image & Action:** Concrete actors + strong verbs; avoid "is/are"
- **Tension & Turn:** Because/Therefore, Not/But, Before/After
- **Cadence:** 8-14 words; favor two-beat rhythm
- **Specific Anchors:** Name time/place/actor/number in every third headline
- **One metaphor family** across the deck (journey OR weather OR architecture, etc.)

See [`checklists.md`](checklists.md) for headline banlist and quality sweeps.
See [`agent-reference-persuasion.md`](agent-reference-persuasion.md) for verbalization techniques.

**Audience-Conditional Headline Adjustments:**
- Consult the selected audience profile in [`audience-profiles.md`](audience-profiles.md) for headline style specific to this audience
- The generic rules above are the baseline; the audience profile overrides where they conflict
- Example: Executive audience headlines should be answer-first and data-anchored; Keynote audience headlines can be more provocative and metaphor-driven

#### Presentation Output Template

```markdown
# [Deck Title]

**Framework:** [Name]
**Density:** [High-Impact / Narrative / Evidence / ELI5]

- **Source attribution:** Inline citations or endnotes as appropriate

#### Prose Rules

- **Section Headers:** Can be longer than slide headlines; clarity over brevity
- **Paragraph Length:** Varies by density mode (Punchy = 2-4 sentences; Flowing = 4-6; Dense = 6-8)
- **Transitions:** Every section connects to the next; no orphan ideas
- **One metaphor family** across the piece (journey OR weather OR architecture, etc.)
- **The Turn:** The reframe/reveal moment gets its own paragraph or short section

#### Prose Output Template

```markdown
# [Title]

**Framework:** [Name]

```

---

### Content Sourcing Tags

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `[DIRECT]` | Quoted or nearly verbatim from source |
| `[PARAPHRASE]` | User's ideas restated |
| `[ELABORATED]` | User's concept expanded |
| `[GENERATED]` | New content for narrative flow |

Include Sourcing Summary at end of output.

---

### Converting Between Formats

#### Prose → Presentation
1. Extract the headline from each section (the single most important sentence)
2. Select ONE spotlight element per section (best example, stat, or quote)
3. Add design notes based on the metaphor family
4. Cut transitions (the deck structure provides flow)

#### Presentation → Prose
1. Headlines become section headers (can expand slightly)
2. Spotlights become opening paragraphs
3. Add development paragraphs (elaboration on the beat)
4. Write transitions between each section
5. Expand the Turn/Reveal moment — it deserves more space in prose

---

## PHASE 4.5: Originality Check

Before sending to the Review Panel, run the Originality & Anti-Sameness Checklist from [`checklists.md`](checklists.md).

If any check fails, revise before proceeding. Key checks:
- Voice profile consistently applied
- Emotional arc matches framework texture
- No three consecutive headlines share grammatical structure
- Killer Line identified and placed
- Opening/closing use selected strategies (not defaults)
- The AI Test: opening doesn't sound generic

---

## PHASE 5: Review Panel

Six specialist agents review the output in parallel.

```
                    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
                    │            DIRECTOR                 │
                    │  Synthesizes, resolves conflicts    │
                    └─────────────────────────────────────┘
                                     ▲
        ┌──────┬──────┬──────────────┼──────────────┬──────┬──────┐
        ▼      ▼      ▼             ▼              ▼      ▼      ▼
   AUDIENCE  COMMS  VISUAL      CRITIC        CONTENT  ORIGINALITY
   ADVOCATE        DESIGNER                   EXPERT    AGENT
```

### Agent Roles

**Audience Advocate** — Reviews as the target audience. Flags what won't land.
- Reference: Audience profile from Phase 2
- Key question: "As [audience], does this resonate? What makes me skeptical?"

**Comms/PR Specialist** — Reviews for messaging, emotion, persuasion.
- Reference: [`agent-reference-persuasion.md`](agent-reference-persuasion.md)
- Key question: "Is the message tight, emotionally resonant, and bulletproof?"

**Visual Designer** — Reviews design notes (presentation) or imagery/metaphor consistency (prose).
- Reference: [`agent-reference-visual.md`](agent-reference-visual.md)
- Key question (presentation): "What visual would make the key slide unforgettable?"
- Key question (prose): "Is the metaphor family consistent? Are images vivid?"

**Critic** — Reviews for pacing, redundancy, weak links.
- Key question: "If I had to cut 20%, what goes? What's the weakest link?"
- Runs Perplexity search for counterarguments and opposing viewpoints.

**Content Expert** — Reviews for accuracy, sourcing, logical validity.
- Reference: [`agent-reference-verification.md`](agent-reference-verification.md)
- Key question: "Can every claim be defended if challenged?"
- Runs Perplexity search for supporting evidence.

**Originality Agent** — Reviews for distinctiveness, freshness, and anti-sameness.
- Reference: [`checklists.md`](checklists.md) — Originality & Anti-Sameness Checklist
- Key questions:
  - "Would this be distinguishable from any other AI-generated piece on this topic?"
  - "Is the Build Brief actually reflected in the output, or did the build revert to generic?"
  - "What's the one element that makes this piece *this piece* and no other?"
- Checks: Voice consistency, emotional arc adherence, headline variety, killer line quality, opening/closing strategy execution
- Flags: Generic patterns, AI-isms, missed opportunities for distinctiveness

### Director Synthesis

Integrates all feedback into unified recommendations:

1. **Consensus items** — Multiple agents agree → high-confidence recommendation
2. **Minor conflicts** — Director decides based on audience/purpose
3. **Strong conflicts** — Escalate to user for decision

**Output format:**

```markdown
## Review Panel Synthesis

### Strengths
- [What's working] — *Agent attribution*

### Recommended Changes
1. **[Change]** — *Agent attribution*
   [Specific recommendation]

### Points Requiring Your Decision
> **Conflict:** [Agent A] says X, [Agent B] says Y
> Which approach? 1. [Option A] 2. [Option B] 3. Keep as-is

### Overall Assessment

> You can also add or swap: Engineer, Skeptic, Risk Officer, CFO, Lawyer, Conservative, COO.
>
> Run it? (yes / yes, but add X / skip)"

### 7 Stress Test Personas

| Persona | Lens | What They Catch |
|---------|------|-----------------|
| **Engineer** | "How does this actually work?" | Hand-wavy claims, logical gaps |
| **Skeptic** | "Why should I believe this?" | Weak proof, confirmation bias |
| **Risk Officer** | "What could go wrong?" | Missing caveats, overconfidence |
| **CFO** | "What are the numbers?" | Fuzzy math, unclear ROI |
| **Lawyer** | "What's the exposure?" | Overpromises, liability |
| **Conservative** | "Why change what's working?" | Unaddressed status-quo concerns |
| **COO** | "Would this actually work?" | Operational blindspots, unrealistic execution |

### Auto-Selection by Content Type

| Content Type | Auto-Selected |
|--------------|---------------|
| Investor pitch | CFO, COO, Skeptic |
| Sales pitch | Skeptic, COO, Engineer |
| Strategic plan | COO, Conservative, Risk Officer |

| Policy recommendation | Lawyer, Risk Officer, Conservative |
| Product launch | COO, Skeptic, Engineer |
| Post-mortem | Engineer, Risk Officer, COO |
| Keynote | Skeptic, Conservative |

### Director Triage

After personas review, Director categorizes:

```markdown
## Stress Test Results

### [Persona] — [PASSED / FLAGGED / FAILED]
**Concerns:**
1. [Concern]

---

## Director Triage

### 🔴 Must Fix (will undermine piece if ignored)
1. **[Issue]** ([Persona]) — [Why it matters and how to fix]

### 🟡 Should Fix (strengthens meaningfully)
1. **[Issue]** ([Persona]) — [Recommendation]

### 🟢 Could Fix (nice-to-have)
1. **[Issue]** ([Persona]) — [Optional improvement]

### Director's Recommendation
[1-2 sentences on what to prioritize]
```

---

## ON-DEMAND: "Tighter"

User can request compression passes anytime after delivery.

When user says "tighter":

1. **Focal check** — Has the point drifted? Re-confirm.
2. **Section pass** — Any sections that could merge or be cut?
3. **Unit pass** — Four-lens compression on every slide/paragraph.
4. **Output** — Tighter version with change summary.

Repeatable until user is satisfied.

---

## ON-DEMAND: Change Log Export

After final delivery (or after any revision pass), offer to export a Change Log:

> "Want me to export a Change Log? This documents what changed from your original content and why — useful for collaborators, future reference, or understanding the transformation."

### Change Log Structure

The Change Log is **not a generic scorecard**. Metrics should be selected based on what actually matters for *this specific piece* given its audience, purpose, and content type.

```markdown
# Change Log: [Title]

**Original:** [Brief description of input — word count, format, state]
**Output:** [Format, word/slide count, framework used]
**Transformation date:** [Date]

---

## Executive Summary

[2-3 sentences: What was the core transformation? What problem did the original have that the output solves?]

---

## Key Changes

### 1. [Change Category]
**What changed:** [Specific description]
**Why:** [Reasoning tied to audience/purpose/framework]
**Example:**
> Original: "[quote from original]"
> Revised: "[quote from output]"

### 2. [Change Category]
[Continue for 3-5 most significant changes]

## Quick Start

1. User provides content
2. Ask output format (Presentation / Prose / Both)
3. Propose focal points → user confirms
4. Ask discovery questions (audience, purpose, content type, tone)
5. Ask density mode (varies by format)
6. **Full sweep** all frameworks → recommend 2 + 1 dark horse → user selects
7. **Generate Build Brief** (voice, audience profile, emotional arc, strategies, killer line candidates) → user confirms
8. Build output guided by Build Brief
9. **Originality check** before review
10. Run Review Panel (6 agents including Originality Agent)
11. Offer Stress Test Panel
12. User requests "tighter" if needed
13. Offer Change Log export
