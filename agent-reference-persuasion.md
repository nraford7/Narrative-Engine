## 1. Made to Stick: SUCCESs Framework
*Chip & Dan Heath*

What makes ideas memorable ("sticky"):

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Simple** | Strip to the core. One idea, deeply meaningful. "If you say three things, you say nothing." |
| **Unexpected** | Break patterns to grab attention. Create curiosity gaps. |
| **Concrete** | Tangible > abstract. Use sensory language, specific examples. |
| **Credible** | Internal credibility via vivid details, verifiable stats, "testable credentials." |
| **Emotional** | Connect to something personal. Individual stories > abstract groups. |
| **Stories** | Mental simulation. Audience puts themselves in protagonist's shoes. |

**The Curse of Knowledge:** Once you know something, you can't imagine not knowing it. Fight this by testing messages on fresh ears.

## 2. Cialdini's 7 Principles of Persuasion

| Principle | How to Apply |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Reciprocity** | Give value first (insight, research, help) before any ask |
| **Commitment/Consistency** | Build micro-agreements. Get small "yes" before big "yes" |
| **Social Proof** | Show similar others doing the thing. "Leaders at [peers] chose this" |
| **Authority** | Establish expertise early. Credentials, track record, third-party validation |
| **Liking** | Find genuine similarity. Compliment authentically. Show you understand their world |
| **Scarcity** | Limited time, limited availability, cost of inaction. "What you'll lose if you don't" |
| **Unity** | Shared identity. "We" language. In-group membership. "People like us do X" |

## 3. Hey Whipple: Advertising Copywriting Principles
*Luke Sullivan*

**Core philosophy:** Advertising is saying one thing brilliantly, not many things adequately.

### Headline Rules
- The headline does 80% of the work. Spend 80% of your time on it.
- Promise a benefit, deliver news, or recognize a problem
- Be specific: percentages, time, dollars saved
- Short and punchy beats clever and long

### Body Copy Rules
- Write like one human being talking to another
- Short sentences. Short paragraphs. Plain words.
- Long copy sells when the stakes are high
- Every word must earn its place

### Concept Development
- Go 180° against common sense — that's where viral ideas live
- Authenticity: figure out how to say it *believably*
- Simplicity: figure out how to say it *quickly*
- Conflict creates faster ideas

### The Whipple Test
Named after Mr. Whipple (annoying but effective Charmin ads):
- Bad ads sometimes work. Great ads sometimes fail.
- But great ads that work are built on truth about the product.

## 4. David Ogilvy: Classic Copywriting Wisdom

**On Headlines:**
> "On average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy. When you have written your headline, you have spent eighty cents out of your dollar."

- Promise a benefit
- Include the brand name when possible
- Use "How to" — it works
- Make it specific and unique (not claimable by competitors)

**On Body Copy:**
- Write to one person, second person singular
- Research your product exhaustively before writing
- Selling is the priority — include calls to action
- Long copy outsells short copy for high-stakes decisions

**On Research:**
> "Advertising people who ignore research are as dangerous as generals who ignore decodes of enemy signals."

## 5. Propaganda Techniques
*Use ethically for awareness; recognize when they're used against you*

| Technique | Description | Ethical Use |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Bandwagon** | "Everyone is doing it" | Social proof for beneficial change |
| **Plain Folks** | "I'm just like you" | Authentic relatability |
| **Glittering Generalities** | Emotionally charged vague words | Replace with concrete specifics |
| **Card Stacking** | Selective presentation of facts | Acknowledge counterarguments |
| **Fear/Uncertainty/Doubt** | Create anxiety about alternatives | Honest risk communication |
| **Transfer** | Associate with respected symbols | Genuine alignment with values |
| **Testimonial** | Endorsement by respected figure | Authentic, relevant endorsers |

## 6. Rhetorical Devices

**Aristotle's Three Appeals:**
- **Ethos:** Credibility and character of the speaker
- **Logos:** Logical argument and evidence
- **Pathos:** Emotional appeal

**Useful Devices:**
- **Anaphora:** Repetition at start of phrases ("I have a dream...")
- **Tricolon:** Three-part list (liberty, equality, fraternity)
- **Antithesis:** Contrasting ideas in parallel structure
- **Rhetorical question:** Engages audience, implies answer

## 7. AIDA Formula

| Stage | Goal | Technique |
|-------|------|-----------|
| **Attention** | Stop the scroll | Bold claim, surprising stat, provocative question |
| **Interest** | Keep them reading | Relevance to their problem |
| **Desire** | Make them want it | Benefits, social proof, vivid outcomes |
| **Action** | Get the response | Clear CTA, reduce friction, urgency |
