# Opening & Closing Strategy Library

Rhetorical strategies for how to *begin* and *end* a narrative piece. These layer **on top of** framework beat structures — the framework defines the structural opening (e.g., "Pledge," "Vault," "Cold Open Outcome"), and this file defines the rhetorical approach used to deliver that beat.

---

## Section 1: Opening Strategies

### 1. Cold Open Scene

**Description:** Drop the audience into a specific moment with sensory detail, no preamble, no context.

**How it works:** Scene-level specificity triggers the brain's narrative processing mode — listeners automatically construct the "who, where, when" around the details you provide. This hijacks attention because the mind cannot resist filling gaps in a concrete scene. By the time you pull back to the thesis, they are already invested.

**Best for:**
- Audience: General public, mixed/cross-functional, sales/marketing
- Purpose: Inspire/motivate, entertain/engage, persuade to act
- Frameworks: Prestige (Pledge beat), Hero's Journey (Ordinary World beat), Freytag (Exposition beat), Trojan Horse (Everyday Scene beat)

**Example:**
> "It's 9:47 on a Tuesday morning. The VP of Customer Success is standing in front of a whiteboard covered in red sticky notes — each one a churned account from the last quarter. She picks one off the board, reads it aloud: 'Loved the product. Left anyway.' She doesn't know it yet, but she's looking at a pricing problem, not a retention problem."

**Avoid when:** Audience is time-constrained executives who expect answer-first delivery. The scene will feel like a delay. Also avoid when you lack genuine concrete detail — a vague scene is worse than no scene.

---

### 2. Provocative Question

**Description:** Open with a single question that challenges a deeply held assumption.

**How it works:** A well-crafted question creates what psychologists call a "curiosity gap" — the brain registers that it has an incomplete mental model and becomes motivated to close the gap. The provocation element is key: if the question merely asks what the audience already wonders, it confirms their frame. If it *challenges* their frame, it creates productive dissonance that holds attention through the answer.

**Best for:**
- Audience: Skeptics/resisters, technical/engineering, academic/research
- Purpose: Persuade to act, defend/justify, inform/educate
- Frameworks: Prestige (Pledge beat), Mystery Box (Riddle beat), Trojan Horse (Wrong Frame beat), Rashomon (Event/Claim beat)

**Example:**
> "What if your customer retention problem doesn't actually exist? What if the customers you're losing are telling you exactly what's wrong — and it has nothing to do with your product, your onboarding, or your support team?"

**Avoid when:** The audience doesn't share the assumption you're challenging. If they don't believe "retention is about product quality" in the first place, challenging it falls flat. Also avoid when trust hasn't been established — provocative questions from unknown speakers feel like gimmicks.

---

### 3. Startling Statistic

**Description:** Lead with one number that is so unexpected it forces the audience to recalibrate.

**How it works:** Numbers activate the brain's analytical processing, but a *surprising* number creates a mismatch between expectation and reality. This mismatch triggers heightened attention and a search for explanation. The key is anchoring: the statistic must violate a specific expectation, not just be "large." One concrete, contextualized number outperforms three generic ones.

**Best for:**
- Audience: Executive/board, technical/engineering, investors/VCs
- Purpose: Report/update, defend/justify, persuade to act
- Frameworks: Heist (Stakes beat), Columbo (Cold Open Outcome beat), Mystery Box (Riddle beat), Prestige (Deepening beat)

**Example:**
> "Sixty-eight percent of the customers your team is calling 'retention losses' would have stayed if you'd changed one number on the pricing page. Not the product. Not the service. The price architecture."

**Avoid when:** The statistic requires heavy caveats to be accurate — if you have to immediately walk it back, you lose the authority you just built. Also avoid when the audience is emotionally driven; numbers can land cold with inspiration-seeking audiences.

---

### 4. Personal Anecdote

**Description:** Open with a brief first-person story that bridges your lived experience to the topic.

**How it works:** Personal stories activate neural coupling — listeners' brains begin to mirror the speaker's brain patterns, creating a shared experience. The first-person frame also signals vulnerability and authenticity, which lowers the audience's defensive posture. The anecdote must be genuinely yours and must connect to the topic within 30 seconds, or it becomes self-indulgent.

**Best for:**
- Audience: General public/keynote, mixed/cross-functional, sales/marketing
- Purpose: Inspire/motivate, align/build consensus, entertain/engage
- Frameworks: Hero's Journey (Ordinary World beat), Trojan Horse (Everyday Scene beat), Freytag (Exposition beat), Game of Scene (Base Reality beat)

**Example:**
> "Three years ago, I sat in a quarterly business review where we spent two hours dissecting why customers were leaving. We built a task force. Hired a Head of Retention. Redesigned the onboarding flow. Nine months and $400K later, churn hadn't moved. It took an intern running a pricing experiment to show us we'd been solving the wrong problem the entire time."

**Avoid when:** You don't have a genuine connection to the topic — borrowed or hypothetical anecdotes undermine the authenticity that makes this strategy work. Also avoid with academic or highly technical audiences who may perceive personal stories as insufficiently rigorous.

---

### 5. Historical Parallel

**Description:** Draw a line from a recognizable historical event to today's situation, revealing the pattern.

**How it works:** Historical parallels leverage analogical reasoning — the brain maps the structure of a known story onto an unknown situation, making the unfamiliar feel graspable. The historical distance also creates safety: audiences can evaluate the parallel objectively before recognizing its implications for their own situation. This works especially well when the historical outcome is well-known but the parallel hasn't been drawn before.

**Best for:**
- Audience: Executive/board, academic/research, investors/VCs
- Purpose: Inform/educate, align/build consensus, defend/justify
- Frameworks: Time Machine (Side Analogy beat), Prestige (Pledge beat), Rashomon (View A/B beats), Columbo (Baseline Theory beat)

**Example:**
> "In 2001, Kodak's customer satisfaction scores were at an all-time high. Customers loved the film. They just stopped buying it. Kodak spent three years optimizing customer retention programs for a product whose price-to-value equation had been permanently broken by digital. Right now, your retention dashboard is telling you the same story Kodak's satisfaction surveys told them."

**Avoid when:** The historical parallel is a stretch — forced analogies (comparing every disruption to Blockbuster) erode credibility. Also avoid when the audience has deep expertise in the historical event and may contest the simplification.

---

### 6. Future Projection

**Description:** Transport the audience to a specific future moment and describe what they see.

**How it works:** Future projections activate prospective memory — the brain's ability to simulate future states. When the simulation is specific and vivid enough, it creates "experience-taking," where the audience temporarily adopts the perspective as if it were happening. This generates emotional stakes for the present-day argument because the audience has already "felt" the future consequence. Present-tense delivery is critical.

**Best for:**
- Audience: Investors/VCs, executive/board, general public/keynote
- Purpose: Inspire/motivate, persuade to act, align/build consensus
- Frameworks: Time Machine (Future Headline beat), Heist (Vault beat), Duarte Resonate (What Could Be beats), Raskin (Promised Land beat)

**Example:**
> "Imagine it's January 2028. Your retention rate hasn't moved in two years, but your revenue is up 35%. Not because you stopped losing customers — you did — but because the pricing restructure you launched in Q2 2026 turned your 'flight risk' segment into your highest-LTV cohort. The customers who were leaving over price became the ones who stayed longest once price matched perceived value."

**Avoid when:** The audience is skeptical or evidence-oriented — speculative futures feel ungrounded to engineers and analysts. Also avoid when the timeline is so distant that consequences feel abstract rather than urgent.

---

### 7. Contradiction

**Description:** State the conventional wisdom, then immediately contradict it with data or evidence.

**How it works:** Contradictions exploit the brain's error-detection system. When a statement clashes with an existing belief, the anterior cingulate cortex fires, creating a "that can't be right" reaction that demands resolution. The audience is pulled forward not by curiosity but by the need to reconcile the conflict. The contradiction must be genuine and defensible — if the audience senses a straw man, the strategy backfires into distrust.

**Best for:**
- Audience: Skeptics/resisters, technical/engineering, academic/research
- Purpose: Persuade to act, defend/justify, inform/educate
- Frameworks: Prestige (Turn beat), Trojan Horse (Wrong Frame / Reframe beats), Columbo (Cold Open Outcome beat), Mystery Box (Failed Attempt beat)

**Example:**
> "You've been told that customer retention is a service problem — that churn means your product isn't delivering enough value. The data says the opposite. In a study of 2,300 churned accounts, 71% rated the product 4 or 5 stars in their exit survey. They didn't leave because your product failed them. They left because your pricing did."

**Avoid when:** You cannot immediately back the contradiction with credible evidence. An unsupported contradiction reads as clickbait, not insight. Also avoid when building consensus — contradictions create winners and losers, which can fracture alignment-seeking audiences.

---

### 8. Shared Pain

**Description:** Name a universal frustration the audience knows intimately, creating instant solidarity.

**How it works:** Shared pain activates in-group bonding — when someone accurately names a frustration you've experienced, you grant them credibility and attention. It signals "I've been where you are," which lowers resistance and positions the speaker as a peer rather than an outsider. The pain must be specific enough to feel authentic (not generic corporate platitudes) and shared widely enough that the majority of the audience recognizes it immediately.

**Best for:**
- Audience: Mixed/cross-functional, sales/marketing, skeptics/resisters
- Purpose: Align/build consensus, persuade to act, inspire/motivate
- Frameworks: PAS (Problem beat), Trojan Horse (Everyday Scene beat), Heist (Stakes beat), Hero's Journey (Ordinary World beat)

**Example:**
> "We've all been in that meeting. The one where someone pulls up the churn dashboard, the room goes quiet, and then someone says 'We need to focus on retention.' So you build a retention team. You redesign onboarding. You launch a loyalty program. And six months later, the same dashboard, the same meeting, the same silence. Because no one asked whether 'retention' was even the right word for what was happening."

**Avoid when:** The audience hasn't experienced the pain you're describing — misidentifying their frustration is worse than not naming it at all. Also avoid when the audience expects data-driven authority rather than empathetic rapport (board presentations, academic settings).

---

## Section 2: Closing Strategies

### 1. Callback

**Description:** Return to the opening image, scene, or phrase — but with the meaning transformed by everything between.

**How it works:** Callbacks exploit the brain's pattern-completion instinct and the peak-end rule. When the audience re-encounters the opening, they involuntarily compare "what I understood then" to "what I understand now," making the transformation tangible and felt rather than merely stated. The gap between the two understandings *is* the argument landing. This also creates a sense of structural closure that signals "this was designed, not improvised."

**Best for:**
- Audience: General public/keynote, mixed/cross-functional, investors/VCs
- Purpose: Inspire/motivate, entertain/engage, persuade to act
- Frameworks: Prestige (Callback beat), Columbo (Callback beat), Trojan Horse (Button beat), Mystery Box (Tag beat)

**Example:**
> "Remember the VP of Customer Success standing in front of that whiteboard? She's still there. But the red sticky notes are gone. She replaced them with a single green one that reads: 'Repriced Q2. Retention up 34%. It was never a retention problem.' She picks it off the board — and puts it on the pricing team's door."

**Avoid when:** Your opening wasn't vivid or specific enough to be remembered. A callback to a forgettable opening reminds the audience they weren't paying attention. Also avoid when the piece took unexpected turns that make the original image no longer relevant.

---

### 2. Challenge

**Description:** End with a direct call to the audience that reframes the decision as inevitable — the only question is timing.

**How it works:** Challenges leverage loss aversion and social pressure. By framing action as inevitable ("this will happen"), you remove the option of inaction from the audience's mental model. The "when" framing is critical: it implies that delay has a cost and early movers gain advantage. This works by shifting the audience's internal question from "should I?" to "when will I?" — a far easier question to answer affirmatively.

**Best for:**
- Audience: Executive/board, sales/marketing, investors/VCs
- Purpose: Persuade to act, inspire/motivate, defend/justify
- Frameworks: Heist (Epilogue Twist beat), Time Machine (Now-cast beat), AIDA (Action beat), PAS (Solution beat)

**Example:**
> "Every company in this room will eventually discover that their retention problem is a pricing problem. The only question is whether you discover it this quarter — while you can still recapture those customers — or two years from now, when they've already rebuilt their workflows around your competitor's pricing model."

**Avoid when:** You don't have the authority to issue a challenge — a junior presenter challenging a boardroom can read as presumptuous. Also avoid when the audience needs more time and information to decide; a premature challenge creates resentment, not action.

---

### 3. Future Vision

**Description:** Paint a vivid, specific picture of the transformed state after the audience acts.

**How it works:** Future vision activates the brain's reward anticipation system. When the audience can see and feel the positive outcome in concrete detail, their motivation shifts from "avoiding the problem" to "reaching the destination." Specificity is everything — vague futures ("a better tomorrow") don't activate the simulation; concrete futures ("your Monday morning retention review becomes a pricing optimization session") do.

**Best for:**
- Audience: Investors/VCs, general public/keynote, executive/board
- Purpose: Inspire/motivate, persuade to act, align/build consensus
- Frameworks: Time Machine (Rewrite Future Headline beat), Duarte Resonate (New Bliss), Raskin (Promised Land), Heist (Payoff beat)

**Example:**
> "Six months from now, your retention team is renamed your pricing intelligence team. The churn dashboard is replaced by a pricing elasticity model that flags at-risk segments before they churn — not after. Your Monday meeting isn't a post-mortem. It's a planning session. And the VP of Customer Success? She's presenting to the board on how a pricing restructure drove the highest net revenue retention in company history."

**Avoid when:** The audience is skeptical and you haven't earned the right to paint an optimistic future — unearned optimism reads as naive. Also avoid when the path from present to future is unclear; a beautiful destination without a visible road creates frustration.

---

### 4. Lingering Question

**Description:** End with one carefully chosen unanswered question that the audience will carry out of the room.

**How it works:** The Zeigarnik effect shows that incomplete tasks occupy the mind more than completed ones. A lingering question turns your presentation into an open loop in the audience's memory, ensuring continued mental engagement after you stop speaking. The question must be genuinely open (not rhetorical) and must arise naturally from the content — it should be the one question your material raises but cannot fully answer.

**Best for:**
- Audience: Academic/research, technical/engineering, executive/board
- Purpose: Inform/educate, entertain/engage, inspire/motivate
- Frameworks: Prestige (Consequences beat), Mystery Box (Limits beat), Rashomon (Consequences beat), Time Machine (Limits beat)

**Example:**
> "We've shown that your retention problem is a pricing problem. We've shown how to restructure. But here's what I can't answer yet: if pricing misalignment is silently draining revenue from your retention numbers, how many other metrics in your business are telling you the symptom instead of the cause?"

**Avoid when:** The audience needs closure and clear action steps — lingering questions frustrate decision-makers who came to the room for answers. Also avoid when the question could be interpreted as "the speaker didn't finish their analysis."

---

### 5. The Simple Truth

**Description:** Strip away every layer of analysis, evidence, and nuance, and state the one-sentence truth.

**How it works:** After sustained complexity, simplicity creates a contrast effect that amplifies impact. The brain experiences relief and clarity simultaneously, which triggers the "aha" response. The simple truth works because the audience has done the work to understand *why* this sentence is true — without the preceding complexity, the same sentence would feel like a platitude. Placement after evidence is what gives it weight.

**Best for:**
- Audience: Executive/board, general public/keynote, mixed/cross-functional
- Purpose: Persuade to act, align/build consensus, report/update
- Frameworks: Trojan Horse (Button beat), Prestige (Prestige beat), Columbo (Playbook beat), Game of Scene (Tag beat)

**Example:**
> "Your customers aren't leaving because they don't love your product. They're leaving because they can't justify your price. Fix the price. Keep the customers."

**Avoid when:** The truth is genuinely complex and cannot be honestly reduced to one sentence without distortion. A false simplification undermines the rigor of everything before it. Also avoid when the audience values nuance as a signal of expertise (academic settings, policy discussions).

---

### 6. Personal Commitment

**Description:** End by stating what *you* are going to do differently starting immediately.

**How it works:** Personal commitment leverages Cialdini's commitment and consistency principle, but in reverse — instead of asking the audience to commit, the speaker commits first. This creates social pressure through reciprocity (the speaker went first) and modeling (the speaker showed it's actionable, not theoretical). The specificity of "Monday morning" signals genuine intent rather than aspirational vagueness.

**Best for:**
- Audience: Mixed/cross-functional, sales/marketing, skeptics/resisters
- Purpose: Align/build consensus, inspire/motivate, persuade to act
- Frameworks: Heist (Getaway beat), Hero's Journey (Return with Elixir beat), Columbo (Playbook beat), PAS (Solution beat)

**Example:**
> "Here's what I'm doing Monday morning. I'm pulling our top 50 churned accounts from last quarter and running them against our pricing tiers — not our satisfaction scores, not our NPS, not our onboarding completion rates. Pricing tiers. Because if even half of what we've seen today holds for our data, we've been spending retention budget on a pricing problem. I'll have preliminary numbers by Wednesday. Who wants to see them?"

**Avoid when:** You are an outsider (consultant, speaker) with no operational role — committing to actions you won't actually take destroys credibility. Also avoid when the audience outranks you and commitment should flow from their authority, not yours.

---

### 7. The Image

**Description:** End with one vivid, concrete image that encapsulates the entire argument.

**How it works:** The picture superiority effect means images are remembered 6x better than words. A single closing image — concrete, specific, sensory — becomes the mental shorthand for your entire argument. When the audience recalls the image later, the associated reasoning comes with it. The image must be novel (not a cliche) and must carry the argument's logic within its structure, not merely illustrate it.

**Best for:**
- Audience: General public/keynote, sales/marketing, investors/VCs
- Purpose: Inspire/motivate, entertain/engage, persuade to act
- Frameworks: Freytag (Button beat), Prestige (Callback beat), Trojan Horse (Button beat), Game of Scene (Tag beat)

**Example:**
> "Picture a fire station that keeps upgrading its hoses, its trucks, its response times — while the house next door quietly burns because nobody checked the wiring. Your retention program is the fire station. Your pricing model is the wiring. Stop buying better hoses."

**Avoid when:** The image oversimplifies a genuinely complex situation — a reductive image can make sophisticated analysis feel glib. Also avoid when the audience is analytically oriented and may see the image as rhetorical decoration rather than substance.

## Section 3: Pairing Matrix

Recommended opening + closing combinations by audience and purpose. Each row represents a common scenario.

| # | Audience | Purpose | Recommended Opening | Recommended Closing | Why |
|---|----------|---------|--------------------|--------------------|-----|
| 1 | Executive / Board | Persuade to act | Startling Statistic | Challenge | Executives respect data-led hooks and respond to urgency framing. Numbers earn attention; the challenge converts it to action. |
| 2 | Executive / Board | Report / update | Contradiction | The Simple Truth | A contradiction signals "this isn't a routine update," and a simple truth gives them the takeaway they'll repeat to their teams. |
| 3 | Technical / Engineering | Inform / educate | Provocative Question | Lingering Question | Technical audiences engage with intellectual puzzles. Opening with a question activates their problem-solving mode; closing with a deeper question respects their desire to continue thinking. |
| 4 | Technical / Engineering | Defend / justify | Startling Statistic | Callback | Data earns credibility with technical audiences. The callback structurally proves that your evidence resolves the opening claim. |
| 5 | Sales / Marketing | Persuade to act | Cold Open Scene | Challenge | Sales teams respond to concrete scenarios and competitive urgency. The scene makes the problem real; the challenge makes inaction uncomfortable. |
| 6 | Sales / Marketing | Inspire / motivate | Shared Pain | Future Vision | Naming the shared frustration builds solidarity; painting the transformed state gives them something to run toward. |
| 7 | Investors / VCs | Persuade to act | Future Projection | Personal Commitment | Investors need to see the destination and believe the team will execute. Future projection shows the market; personal commitment shows the founder's conviction. |
| 8 | Investors / VCs | Inspire / motivate | Historical Parallel | Future Vision | The historical pattern validates the thesis without requiring trust in projections. The future vision translates pattern into this specific opportunity. |
| 9 | General Public / Keynote | Entertain / engage | Cold Open Scene | The Image | Keynotes are remembered by their moments. A vivid opening scene and a closing image create the two anchors that survive in memory. |
| 10 | General Public / Keynote | Inspire / motivate | Personal Anecdote | Callback | The personal story creates connection; the callback completes the emotional arc and makes the audience feel they've been on a journey. |
| 11 | Skeptics / Resisters | Persuade to act | Shared Pain | The Simple Truth | Skeptics resist being sold to. Shared pain signals "I'm with you, not against you." The simple truth respects their intelligence by not over-arguing. |
| 12 | Skeptics / Resisters | Defend / justify | Contradiction | Lingering Question | Contradicting the common objection head-on shows confidence. The lingering question invites skeptics to continue the inquiry rather than demanding immediate conversion. |
| 13 | Mixed / Cross-functional | Align / build consensus | Shared Pain | Personal Commitment | Alignment requires "we" energy. Shared pain establishes common ground; personal commitment models the behavior you want others to adopt. |
| 14 | Mixed / Cross-functional | Persuade to act | Cold Open Scene | Future Vision | Mixed audiences need a shared entry point that doesn't favor one group's expertise. A concrete scene is universally accessible; a future vision gives everyone the same destination. |
| 15 | Academic / Research | Inform / educate | Historical Parallel | Lingering Question | Academics respect precedent and intellectual rigor. A historical parallel signals scholarly framing; a lingering question acknowledges the ongoing nature of inquiry. |
| 16 | Academic / Research | Defend / justify | Provocative Question | The Simple Truth | Challenging the assumption creates intellectual engagement. After thorough evidence, the simple truth demonstrates that the complexity resolves to a defensible claim. |

**Distinct primary pairs appearing above:** Startling Statistic + Challenge, Contradiction + The Simple Truth, Provocative Question + Lingering Question, Startling Statistic + Callback, Cold Open Scene + Challenge, Shared Pain + Future Vision, Future Projection + Personal Commitment, Historical Parallel + Future Vision, Cold Open Scene + The Image, Personal Anecdote + Callback, Shared Pain + The Simple Truth, Contradiction + Lingering Question, Shared Pain + Personal Commitment, Cold Open Scene + Future Vision, Historical Parallel + Lingering Question, Provocative Question + The Simple Truth.

## Section 4: Anti-Repetition Rule

When building, consult this file and select an opening and closing strategy that fits the Build Brief. Do NOT default to the framework's standard opening beat used generically. The framework defines the *structural* opening; this file defines the *rhetorical* opening. They combine: the Prestige's Pledge beat might use a Cold Open Scene or a Shared Pain opening. Note the selected strategies in the Build Brief.

**Enforcement process:**

1. During the Build Brief (Phase 4 setup), review the audience + purpose combination against the Pairing Matrix above.
2. Select an opening strategy and a closing strategy. If the matrix row fits, use it as a starting point. If the specific combination doesn't appear, select based on the individual opening and closing "Best for" guidance.
3. Record the selections in the Build Brief header:
   ```
   **Opening Strategy:** [Name] — [one-line rationale]
   **Closing Strategy:** [Name] — [one-line rationale]
   ```
4. When writing the opening beat and closing beat of the chosen framework, use the selected rhetorical strategy to deliver that beat's content.
5. If two consecutive builds for the same user use the same opening-closing pair, flag it and suggest an alternative from this file.

## Section 5: Combining Strategies with Framework Beats

Opening and closing strategies are the rhetorical *skin* over the framework's structural *skeleton*. The framework beat tells you **what** that section must accomplish; the strategy tells you **how** to deliver it. Here is how specific combinations work in practice.

### Prestige's Pledge + Cold Open Scene

The Pledge beat must establish the "ordinary world" — what everyone believes. A Cold Open Scene delivers this by dropping into a specific moment where the conventional wisdom is visibly operating. Instead of stating "most companies treat retention as a service problem," you *show* a retention team in action, radiating competence while unknowingly solving the wrong problem. The scene makes the Pledge feel lived-in rather than asserted.

### Heist's Vault + Startling Statistic

The Vault beat must define the goal — what we're trying to achieve and why it matters. A Startling Statistic delivers this by quantifying the prize. Instead of "we need to improve retention," you open with the revenue number that retention-through-pricing-reform is worth. The statistic makes the Vault concrete and gives the audience a number to anchor the rest of the heist against.

### Columbo's Cold Open Outcome + Contradiction

The Cold Open Outcome beat must state the result upfront. A Contradiction delivers this by juxtaposing the outcome against the expected explanation. Instead of "retention dropped 18% last quarter," you say "retention dropped 18%, and every metric our team tracks says it shouldn't have." The contradiction turns the Columbo opening from a report into a mystery — the audience knows *what* happened but now urgently needs to know *why*.

### Time Machine's Rewrite Future Headline + Future Vision

The Rewrite Future Headline beat closes by returning to the future state with a revised understanding. A Future Vision closing strategy delivers this by making that revised future vivid and sensory rather than analytical. Instead of restating the thesis, you describe the Monday morning after the transformation — the new dashboard, the new meeting rhythm, the new conversation. The vision makes the abstract rewrite emotionally tangible.

### Trojan Horse's Button + The Simple Truth

The Button beat must deliver a memorable closing that cements the reframe. The Simple Truth strategy delivers this by compressing the entire reframe into one sentence. After walking the audience through escalating examples and the reframe, stripping everything to "your customers aren't leaving because of your product; they're leaving because of your price" creates a sentence they will repeat. The Button is the nail; The Simple Truth is the hammer.

### Rashomon's Callback + Callback (Strategy)

The Rashomon Callback beat returns to the opening claim, now transformed by the integrative frame. The Callback closing strategy layers on by repeating the exact opening language with altered meaning. If you opened with "Should we invest in retention?", you close with the same question — but now the audience hears "retention" differently. The repetition makes the transformation audible. The words haven't changed; the audience has.
