# Example Workflow: Climate Technology Keynote

This example shows the Narrative Engine workflow applied to a keynote speech about climate technology breakthroughs, demonstrating the **Time Machine** framework, **TED Stage** voice, **Future Projection** opening, and **Future Vision** closing. Compare with the [remote work example](remote-work-example.md) (Prestige + Boardroom) and the [post-mortem example](post-mortem-technical-example.md) (Columbo + Investigator) to see how the system produces fundamentally different output.

## Input

**User:** [Pastes 3,200-word article about breakthroughs in direct air capture (DAC) technology, including recent cost curve data, a partnership between a startup called Verdant and a cement company, and projections about reaching cost parity with traditional carbon offset programs by 2029]

---

## Phase 1.5: Output Format

**Claude:**
> **What format do you need?**
> 1. **Presentation** — Slide deck with headlines, spotlights, and design notes
> 2. **Prose** — Long-form document with sections, transitions, and flow
> 3. **Both** — Build one, derive the other (specify which first)

**User:** 1 — Presentation

---

## Phase 1.75: Focal Discovery

**Claude:**
> I've reviewed your article on direct air capture technology. Based on the content, I see these potential focal points:
>
> 1. **The cost tipping point:** DAC costs have dropped 74% in 4 years and are on track to undercut traditional carbon offsets by 2029 — this reframes DAC from "expensive moonshot" to "inevitable infrastructure"
> 2. **The Verdant-cement partnership model:** Industrial emitters becoming carbon removal partners creates a self-funding flywheel — and it's already working
> 3. **The speed of deployment:** DAC is following the solar cost curve, but compressed into half the timeline — we're living through the early years of a technology that will reshape how civilization handles carbon
>
> Which direction should we optimize for? Or is there a different point you want to land?

**User:** 3 — the speed angle, but weave in the cost data as evidence

**Claude:**
> Got it. Our focal statement: **"Direct air capture is following the solar cost curve at double the speed — and the decisions we make in the next 24 months will determine whether this technology reshapes our world or stays trapped in pilot programs."**
>
> The One Thing: DAC's trajectory is faster than any previous clean energy technology.
> The Ask: Act now — fund, build, partner, deploy — because the window for shaping this is brief.
> The Through-Line: Speed. Every beat traces back to how fast this is moving and why that speed demands action.

## Phase 3: Framework Recommendation — Full Sweep

**Claude:**
> Based on your inputs:
> - General Public / Keynote audience
> - Inspire / Motivate purpose
> - Vision/inspiration piece
> - Visionary / Aspirational tone
> - Narrative density
>
> ### Step 1: Full Arc Scoring
>
> | Arc | Fit (1-5) | Key reason |
> |-----|-----------|------------|
> | A) Prestige | 3 | Has a counterintuitive element (DAC faster than solar), but the structure serves debunking better than inspiration |
> | B) Mystery Box | 2 | No real mystery to solve — the story is about a future unfolding, not a puzzle |
> | C) Heist | 3 | Could frame as "the plan to capture carbon" but feels too operational for a keynote |
> | D) Time Machine | 5 | Perfect fit — the content is literally about two futures (act now vs. delay), speed of change, and a decision fork |
> | E) Trojan Horse | 3 | Could reframe "DAC is expensive moonshot" → "DAC is inevitable infrastructure," but the content is more forward-looking than assumption-breaking |
> | F) Hero's Journey | 4 | Strong for the Verdant partnership narrative, but the piece is about a technology trajectory, not a single transformation story |
> | G) Freytag | 3 | The dramatic arc could work for the "race against time" framing, but Freytag is better for stories with a clear climax-and-resolution, and this is more about a fork than a climax |
> | H) Columbo | 1 | Outcome-first reconstruction doesn't fit — we don't know the outcome yet |
> | I) Game of Scene | 2 | No hidden pattern to name — the pattern (cost curves) is the explicit subject |
> | J) Rashomon | 2 | No competing perspectives to synthesize |
>
> ### Step 2: Top Communication Frameworks
>
> | Framework | Fit (1-5) | Key reason |
> |-----------|-----------|------------|
> | Duarte Resonate | 4 | Oscillation between "what is" and "what could be" fits the visionary tone perfectly |
> | SUCCESs (Concrete + Emotional) | 3 | Useful overlay for making the vision tangible |
> | Story Circle | 3 | Audience-as-hero could work — "you are the generation that decides" |
> | Schwartz Awareness | 2 | Not much awareness variation needed — general public starting from similar baseline |
> | Cialdini (Unity) | 3 | "We" framing useful but not the primary driver |
>
> ---
>
> ## Recommendation 1: Time Machine + Duarte Resonate ★★★★★
>
> **Why this works:** Your content is literally about two possible futures and the speed at which we're approaching a decision point. Time Machine gives you the "future headline → tiny past cause → two timelines → fork" structure, and the Duarte overlay lets you oscillate between the current reality and the future possibility throughout — which is exactly how visionary keynotes build emotional momentum.
>
> **Your content in this structure:**
> 1. **Future Headline:** "It's 2031. The air above a cement plant in Gujarat is cleaner coming out than going in."
> 2. **Tiny Past Cause:** A 2024 engineering breakthrough cut DAC energy requirements by 60%
> 3. **Side Analogy:** Solar's cost curve — and how DAC is running it at double speed
> 4. **Present Decision:** The 24-month window where funding, policy, and partnership decisions lock in which future we get
> 5. **Timeline A:** We act — DAC reaches cost parity by 2029, industrial partnerships scale
> 6. **Timeline B:** We delay — DAC stays in pilot mode, the cost curve stalls, the window closes
> 7. **Fork Reveal:** "This isn't a technology problem or a cost problem. It's a speed problem. The technology is ready. The question is whether we are."
> 8. **Levers:** Three things the audience can influence
> 9. **Rewrite Future Headline:** The 2031 headline, rewritten as chosen rather than hypothetical
>
> **Emotional preview:** Wonder (the future scene) → vertigo (how small the cause was) → recognition (the solar parallel) → fork anxiety (two timelines) → clarity → agency → resolve
>
> **Tradeoffs:**
> - Strength: Creates a genuine "two futures" emotional experience; the audience *feels* the fork
> - Strength: Underused framework — audience hasn't seen this shape before
> - Risk: The Side Analogy (solar parallel) could feel tangential if not tightly linked to DAC speed
>
> ## Recommendation 2: Hero's Journey + Duarte Resonate ★★★★
>
> **Why this works:** The Verdant-cement partnership is a genuine transformation story. You could frame the technology itself as the "hero" moving through obstacles to transformation.
>
> **Tradeoffs:**
> - Strength: Deeply emotional; audiences connect with transformation narratives
> - Risk: Narrows focus to one company's story when the content is about a systemic shift
>
> ## Dark Horse: Freytag's Five-Act ★★★
>
> **Why this is interesting:** The "race against time" element of your content has genuine dramatic tension — the clock is ticking, the cost curve is dropping, the question is whether deployment matches the technology's readiness. Freytag would let you build rising action through the accelerating cost drops and culminate in a climactic moment: the exact point where DAC undercuts offsets. It would feel more like a thriller than a vision piece — different, unexpected, and potentially more gripping.
>
> **What it would unlock:** A sense of urgency through dramatic structure rather than futuristic vision. Less "imagine the world" and more "the world is changing right now and we're watching it happen in real time."
>
> ## Rejection Log
>
> Columbo (1) is designed for outcomes already known — this is forward-looking. Mystery Box (2) and Rashomon (2) require puzzle structures and competing perspectives that don't exist in this content. Game of Scene (2) names hidden patterns, but the pattern here (cost curves) is the explicit subject, not a hidden dynamic.

## Phase 3.5: Build Brief

**Claude:**
> ### Build Brief
>
> **Focal Statement:** Direct air capture is following the solar cost curve at double the speed — and the decisions we make in the next 24 months will determine whether this technology reshapes our world or stays trapped in pilot programs.
>
> **Framework:** Time Machine (D) + Duarte Resonate overlay
> **Density:** Narrative
>
> **Voice Profile:** TED Stage (auto-derived: General Public + Visionary)
> - Vary sentence length deliberately — long followed by short. Four words. Then expand again.
> - Educated-accessible register: smart but never exclusionary. Ground every technical concept in a universal experience.
> - Use rhetorical questions every 3-4 paragraphs. Use "we" and "you" naturally.
> - Signature moves to deploy: The Personal Bridge, The Reframe Question, The Callback
>
> **Audience Profile:** General Public / Keynote
> - Trust signals: Relatable human examples, everyday analogies, "this person understands what this means for people like me"
> - Resistance triggers to avoid: Undefined jargon, data tables, condescension, going more than 3 paragraphs without a story
> - Evidence style: "One person" stories, physical scale comparisons, before/after transformations
> - Headline style: Intriguing promises or vivid images. Sensory or narrative language. "Tell me more" energy.
>
> **Emotional Arc:** Time Machine emotional texture
> - Shape: Wonder → vertigo → recognition → fork anxiety → clarity → agency → resolve
> - Intensity dial: 4-5 (General Public — full emotional range available)
> - Key emotional moment: Beat 7 — the Fork Reveal. Name the false frame ("This looks like a choice between expensive technology and waiting for something cheaper"), then deliver the reframe in one clean sentence ("The real choice is whether we lead or follow"). Audience should feel relief and intellectual excitement simultaneously.
>
> **Persuasion Strategy:**
> - Primary: Unity — "We are the generation that decides." Create shared identity around the decision point.
> - Secondary: Reciprocity — Give the audience a new way of seeing (the solar-speed comparison) before asking for anything.
>
> **Opening Strategy:** Future Projection — Transport audience to 2031. Present tense. Sensory detail. They are *there*. Combined with Time Machine's Future Headline beat.
>
> **Closing Strategy:** Future Vision — Paint the chosen future vividly. Combined with Time Machine's Rewrite Future Headline beat. The same scene from the opening, but now it feels chosen rather than hypothetical.
>
> **Killer Line Candidates:**
> 1. "The technology is ready. The question is whether we are."
> 2. "DAC is doing in four years what solar took eight. The air doesn't care about our timelines."
> 3. "We're not waiting for a breakthrough. The breakthrough is waiting for us."
>
> **Anti-Sameness Notes:** Keynote audiences have heard "imagine a world where" a thousand times. The Future Projection must be cinematic and specific — not generic futurism. Name a place, a smell, a sound. Avoid "game-changing," "paradigm shift," "revolutionary." Let the data be revolutionary; keep the language human.

> Here's the Build Brief I'll use to guide the output. Anything you'd change before I build?

**User:** Love it. The third killer line candidate is the strongest — use that one. Build it.

## Phase 4: Build (Abbreviated — 4 Slides Shown)

**Claude generates deck guided by Build Brief:**

```markdown
# The Air Is Changing: Why Direct Air Capture Won't Wait for Us

**Framework:** Time Machine (D) + Duarte Resonate
**Density:** Narrative
**Focal Statement:** DAC is following the solar cost curve at double the speed — and the next 24 months determine whether it reshapes our world or stalls in pilot programs.
**Metaphor family:** Speed/momentum (racing, acceleration, windows opening and closing)
**Voice:** TED Stage
**Emotional arc:** Wonder → vertigo → recognition → fork anxiety → clarity → agency → resolve
**Opening strategy:** Future Projection
**Closing strategy:** Future Vision
**Killer Line:** "We're not waiting for a breakthrough. The breakthrough is waiting for us."

## Slide 1 — Future Headline (Beat 1)
**Headline:** It's 2031 and the air above a cement plant in Gujarat smells like rain

**Spotlight (≤60 words):** You're standing outside the Verdant-Dalmia facility. Trucks roll past carrying limestone. The plant produces 2.3 million tons of cement a year and removes 400,000 tons of CO2 from the atmosphere while doing it. The intake fans hum at a pitch you can feel in your chest. The air coming out is measurably cleaner than the air going in.

**Design note:** Full-bleed photograph of an industrial facility at dawn, mist rising. No stock photo — commission or use documentary-style image. The beauty should feel unexpected against the industrial setting.

**Source:** [ELABORATED]

---

## Slide 2 — Tiny Past Cause (Beat 2)
**Headline:** Seven years ago, a chemical engineer in Calgary changed one number in a formula

**Spotlight (≤60 words):** In 2024, Dr. Priya Nair's team at Verdant published a paper showing that a modified calcium looping process cut DAC energy requirements by 62%. The paper was 14 pages. It cited a variable — the regeneration temperature threshold — that the rest of the field had treated as fixed since 2019. She asked: what if it isn't?

**Design note:** Split screen — left: a handwritten equation on a whiteboard with one variable circled. Right: the 2031 facility from Slide 1. Visual connection between the small and the massive.

**Source:** [PARAPHRASE]

---

## Slide 3 — Side Analogy (Beat 3)
**Headline:** Solar panels took eight years to drop 74% in cost — DAC did it in four

**Spotlight (≤60 words):** Here's the number that should rewrite how you think about this technology. Solar's cost revolution — the one that changed global energy — followed a learning curve from 2010 to 2018. Direct air capture has matched that curve in half the time. Not because DAC is simpler. Because we already knew how to build the infrastructure. We just needed the chemistry to catch up.

**Design note:** Single animated chart showing two cost curves overlaid — solar (8-year slope) and DAC (4-year slope, steeper). Minimal labels. The visual does the talking.

**Source:** [DIRECT]

---

## Slide 4 — Present Decision / Fork Setup (Beat 4)
**Headline:** Right now, 127 decisions in 43 countries will determine which future we get

**Spotlight (≤60 words):** There are 127 DAC projects currently awaiting funding approval, permitting, or partnership agreements across 43 countries. Each one is a small bet on a future that either scales or stalls. And here's the thing about cost curves: they only keep dropping if deployment keeps climbing. Pause the deployment, and the curve flattens. We've seen it happen before. We're watching it not happen — yet — with DAC.

**Design note:** World map with 127 pulsing dots. No country borders — just the dots. The density of possibility, not the complexity of geopolitics.

## Sourcing Summary

**Originality Score:** 65% user-sourced / 35% generated

- Direct from source: 3 slides
- Paraphrased: 3 slides
- Elaborated: 3 slides
- Generated: 2 slides (transitions, the fork framing)
```

---

## Phase 4.5: Originality Check (Internal)

Before sending to Review Panel, the Originality & Anti-Sameness checklist is run:

- [x] Opening uses Future Projection strategy, not a generic framework default
- [x] Closing uses Future Vision strategy, combined with Rewrite Future Headline beat
- [x] No three consecutive headlines share grammatical structure (declarative, declarative, declarative — wait: slides 1-3 are all declarative statements. **FLAG.** Slide 2 restructured to use a different construction.)
- [x] Voice profile check: TED Stage verified — varied sentence lengths, rhetorical questions present, "we/you" language, Personal Bridge signature move in Slide 2
- [x] Killer Line placed at Fork Reveal (high-impact moment): "We're not waiting for a breakthrough. The breakthrough is waiting for us."
- [x] AI Test: Opening does NOT use "In today's rapidly changing..." or "Imagine a world where..." — it drops into a specific, sensory scene

**Revision made:** Slide 2 headline changed from "In 2024, a chemical engineer changed one number in a formula" to "Seven years ago, a chemical engineer in Calgary changed one number in a formula" — adds specificity and breaks the declarative pattern by opening with a time anchor.

## Phase 5: Review Panel (Abbreviated)

**Claude:**
> ## Review Panel Synthesis
>
> ### Strengths
> - The Future Projection opening is genuinely immersive — "smells like rain" is a sensory detail that earns attention immediately — *Comms Specialist*
> - The solar cost curve comparison is the single most powerful persuasion tool in the deck; it reframes DAC from "emerging tech" to "proven trajectory" — *Audience Advocate*
> - The Tiny Past Cause beat (one variable in one equation) creates the wonder/vertigo emotional shift perfectly — *Comms Specialist*
> - Fork Reveal killer line is strong and repeatable — *Originality Agent*
>
> ### Recommended Changes
>
> **Messaging**
> - Slide 4 headline: "127 decisions in 43 countries" is data-heavy for a keynote audience. Consider: "Right now, the future of this technology rests on 127 decisions nobody's talking about" — more intrigue, less spreadsheet — *Audience Advocate*
>
> **Originality**
> - Slide 3 spotlight uses "Here's the number that should rewrite how you think" — this is a TED cliche. The data is genuinely startling; it doesn't need rhetorical scaffolding. Let the comparison land on its own: "Solar panels took eight years to drop 74% in cost. Direct air capture did it in four." Full stop. Trust the audience. — *Originality Agent*
>
> **Emotional Arc**
> - The transition from Side Analogy (Beat 3) to Present Decision (Beat 4) needs a stronger emotional bridge. The audience is in "recognition" mode — they need a moment of "this affects me" before you hit them with the fork. Consider adding a one-line transition slide: a single question that makes the speed personal — *Comms Specialist*
>
> **Visual**
> - Slide 1 design note calls for a commissioned photograph. Suggest instead: a 4K video still from documentary footage of an actual DAC facility. The "real" quality matters for the opening's credibility — *Visual Designer*
>
> ### Points Requiring Your Decision
> > **Conflict:** Audience Advocate recommends softening Slide 4's data-heavy headline, while Content Expert notes the specificity (127, 43) builds credibility. Which approach?
> > 1. Soften to "127 decisions nobody's talking about" (more intrigue)
> > 2. Keep the numbers (more credibility)
> > 3. Hybrid: "127 quiet decisions will shape the next century of air"
>
> ### Originality Agent — Detailed Findings
>
> **Flagged:**
> 1. Slide 3 spotlight: "Here's the number that should rewrite how you think about this technology" — generic TED-talk phrasing. **Fix: Strip the scaffolding. Lead with the comparison directly.**
> 2. The deck's metaphor family (speed/momentum) is applied well but "window opening and closing" appears in both Slide 4 and the Fork Reveal — diversify the metaphor at one of these points.
>
> **Passed:**
> - Voice consistency: TED Stage voice is well-maintained across all slides checked — varied sentence length, "we/you" language, personal bridges, no jargon without grounding
> - Emotional arc: Wonder → vertigo → recognition progression tracks correctly across Slides 1-3
> - Killer line quality: "We're not waiting for a breakthrough. The breakthrough is waiting for us." — passes all tests (< 15 words each clause, concrete, surprising inversion, repeatable)
> - Opening distinctiveness: The Gujarat cement plant scene is specific and original — not generic futurism
>
> ### Overall Assessment
> **Ready to present?** Yes with edits
> **Most important improvement:** Fix the Slide 3 TED cliche flagged by the Originality Agent — the data is strong enough to stand alone.

---

## Originality Fix Applied

Before the Originality Agent flagged it, Slide 3's spotlight read:

> "Here's the number that should rewrite how you think about this technology. Solar's cost revolution — the one that changed global energy — followed a learning curve from 2010 to 2018. Direct air capture has matched that curve in half the time..."

After the fix:

> "Solar panels dropped 74% in cost between 2010 and 2018. That decline rewired global energy. Direct air capture has matched that decline — but in four years, not eight. Not because DAC is simpler. Because we already knew how to build the infrastructure. We just needed the chemistry to catch up."

The scaffolding sentence ("Here's the number that should rewrite...") was cut. The comparison now leads with the concrete fact and lets the audience do the "rewriting" themselves — which is exactly how the TED Stage voice's signature move (The Reframe Question) works: you set up the reframe and let the audience arrive at it.

---

## What This Example Demonstrates

1. **Full Sweep Protocol:** All 10 arcs scored with reasons, not just the obvious picks presented. Time Machine emerged as the top choice because the content is genuinely about two futures and speed — not because it's the default.

2. **Build Brief as bridge:** Every Build Brief element (voice, audience profile, emotional arc, opening/closing strategy, killer line candidates, anti-sameness notes) translated discovery answers into concrete writing instructions. The build output reflects these instructions — the TED Stage voice is audible in the sentence structures, the General Public audience profile is visible in the absence of jargon and the presence of sensory detail.

3. **Voice Profile in action:** Compare the TED Stage voice here with the Investigator voice in the [post-mortem example](post-mortem-technical-example.md). The sentence structures, vocabulary, emotional register, and paragraph rhythms are fundamentally different — not just in topic, but in *how the writing moves*.

4. **Emotional Arc calibrated to audience:** Intensity dial at 4-5 (General Public). Full emotional range deployed: wonder in the opening scene, vertigo in the tiny past cause, recognition at the solar parallel, fork anxiety in the two timelines. An Executive audience version of this same content would suppress almost all of this, running at intensity 2.

5. **Opening/Closing Strategy layered on framework:** Future Projection delivers the Time Machine's Future Headline beat — but the *rhetorical* approach (present tense, sensory detail, "you are there") comes from the opening strategy, not the framework default.

6. **Originality Agent catching real issues:** The Slide 3 "Here's the number that should rewrite how you think" was a genuine TED-talk cliche that would have weakened the piece. The fix — stripping the rhetorical scaffolding and trusting the data — improved the output and demonstrated that the Originality Agent adds value, not just process.

7. **Subagent architecture in action:** The build phase ran as a separate subagent reading the Build Brief from `/tmp/`, and all six review agents ran in parallel — reducing context window pressure while maintaining the full quality pipeline.
