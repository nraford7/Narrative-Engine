# Voice Profiles

Seven distinct writing voices for the Narrative Engine. The voice is auto-derived from audience + tone during the Build Brief phase (see [Auto-Derive Mapping Matrix](#auto-derive-mapping-matrix)), but the user can override it at any time.

> **Override:** If the user names a voice directly ("use the Provocateur voice") or describes a voice ("write this like a skeptical journalist"), honor that over the auto-derive result.

## 1. Boardroom

### Description

The voice of a CFO presenting to the board at 8am on a Monday. Every word costs money; waste none.

### Sentence structure

Keep sentences between 5 and 12 words. Default to declarative structure: subject-verb-object. Avoid subordinate clauses. Use sentence fragments when they sharpen the point. Never stack more than two sentences before a data anchor. Rhythm: short, short, data. Short, short, data.

### Vocabulary

Use executive-level register. Prefer concrete nouns over abstract ones: say "revenue" not "financial performance," say "headcount" not "human capital resources." Ban hedging language: no "arguably," "somewhat," "it could be said that." Allow one hedge per piece only when genuine uncertainty exists, and flag it explicitly: "This number carries a +/- 15% margin." Eliminate adverbs. Kill adjectives unless they are numerical.

### Paragraph rhythm

Build paragraphs in 2-3 sentences maximum. Open with the claim. Follow with the evidence. Close with the implication or action. Do not vary paragraph length for aesthetic effect; uniformity signals control. Use one-sentence paragraphs for pivots or directives.

### Emotional register

Suppress emotion almost entirely. Let numbers carry the emotional weight. The only acceptable emotional note is controlled urgency: "We have 90 days." Do not inspire. Do not warm. Present facts and let gravity do the work.

### Signature moves

1. **The Data Sandwich:** Place a specific number within the first two sentences of every paragraph. Wrap claims around quantitative evidence so the reader never floats untethered from reality.
2. **The Directive Close:** End sections with a clear action statement. Not a suggestion. A recommendation stated as fact: "We reallocate Q3 budget to product. Finance models this by Friday."
3. **Strategic Silence:** Leave implications unstated when the data is damning enough. After presenting the number, stop. Let the room do the math.

### Example paragraph

Last quarter, NovaCorp held 23% market share. This quarter: 14%. The legacy product line accounts for 81% of revenue and is declining at 6% per quarter. The pivot to cloud services requires $40M and 18 months. We begin in Q2 or we don't begin at all. The board should approve reallocation by March 15.

### Auto-derive rule

Select Boardroom when audience is Executive or Investors and tone is Authoritative, Urgent, or Balanced. Also select when any audience combines with Urgent tone and the content type involves strategic decisions or financial reporting.

---

## 2. TED Stage

### Description

The voice of someone who has earned the right to stand on a big stage and chooses to talk *with* the audience, not *at* them. Authority worn lightly, ideas built collaboratively.

### Sentence structure

Vary sentence length deliberately. Follow a long, complex sentence with a short one. Four words. Then expand again, pulling the reader through a rhythm that mimics natural speech. Use rhetorical questions every 3-4 paragraphs to keep the audience leaning in. Fragments are fine when they land a beat. Start occasional sentences with "And" or "But" to maintain conversational momentum.

### Vocabulary

Use educated-accessible register: smart but never exclusionary. Prefer vivid, concrete language over abstraction. When introducing a technical concept, immediately ground it in a universal experience. Ban jargon unless you define it in the same breath. Favor active verbs that create mental images: "collide," "unravel," "spark" over "impact," "leverage," "utilize." First-person plural ("we") appears naturally. Second-person ("you") pulls the audience into the argument.

### Paragraph rhythm

Build paragraphs in 3-5 sentences. Open with a hook, observation, or question. Develop through a bridge from the personal to the universal. Close by pointing the reader toward what comes next. Alternate between shorter punch paragraphs (1-2 sentences) and longer development paragraphs. Create a breathing pattern: expand, contract, expand.

### Emotional register

Emotion is present and intentional. Move between curiosity, surprise, and shared recognition. Build toward moments of collective realization: the "aha" is something the audience experiences together, not something delivered to them. Avoid sentimentality. The emotional palette is wonder, determination, and clear-eyed honesty, not warmth for warmth's sake.

### Signature moves

1. **The Personal Bridge:** Begin a point with a specific personal anecdote or observation, then pivot to the universal principle it reveals. "Last Tuesday I watched a barista remake the same drink four times. She wasn't being difficult. She was doing what every great company refuses to do: admitting the first version wasn't good enough."
2. **The Reframe Question:** Ask a question that reframes the entire problem. Not "How do we fix this?" but "What if the thing we're trying to fix is actually the thing we should be building on?"
3. **The Callback:** Plant a detail early and return to it later with new meaning. The audience feels the click of connection.

### Example paragraph

Here's what nobody tells you about a pivot: it's not a turn. It's a demolition and a rebuild happening at the same time, while customers are still living in the building. NovaCorp looked at their numbers last quarter and saw what everyone in this room has seen at some point: the thing that built you is now the thing that's slowing you down. Their legacy product was 81% of revenue. It was also 81% of the reason they couldn't move. So they made a choice that sounds simple and is anything but. They decided to stop being the company they were and start becoming the company the market actually needs. The question isn't whether that's brave. The question is: what are the rest of us waiting for?

### Auto-derive rule

Select TED Stage when audience is General Public, Sales/Marketing, or Mixed and tone is Authoritative, Balanced, or Visionary. Also select for any audience when tone is Visionary, unless the audience is Executive, Investors, or Academic.

---

## 3. Provocateur

### Description

The voice that says the uncomfortable thing everyone is thinking but nobody will put in a memo. Not contrarian for sport -- contrarian because the comfortable consensus is often wrong.

### Sentence structure

Alternate sharply between short punches (3-7 words) and longer elaborations (15-25 words) that unpack the provocation. Never let the reader settle into a rhythm. Use sentence fragments as weapons. Start sentences with "But." Start sentences with "And." Start sentences with the word the reader least expects. Favor imperative mood: "Stop pretending," "Look at the data," "Ask yourself."

### Vocabulary

Use direct, muscular language. Prefer verbs that create confrontation: "expose," "dismantle," "refuse," "confront." Ban corporate euphemism ruthlessly: say "fired" not "rightsized," say "failed" not "experienced headwinds," say "wrong" not "suboptimal." Use "you" frequently and directly. Name the sacred cows before slaughtering them. Sarcasm is permitted but deploy it surgically, never as a crutch.

### Paragraph rhythm

Keep paragraphs to 2-4 sentences. Open with a provocative claim or a direct challenge. Follow with evidence that makes the challenge undeniable. Close with an implication the reader cannot ignore. Occasionally use a single-sentence paragraph for maximum impact. Build sections as a series of escalating provocations, each one raising the stakes.

### Emotional register

Channel controlled anger, intellectual impatience, and moral clarity. The emotion is not personal; it is directed at complacency, groupthink, and institutional cowardice. Never whine. Never plead. The Provocateur does not ask the reader to agree -- the Provocateur makes the cost of disagreement visible.

### Signature moves

1. **The Sacred Cow Barbecue:** Name the assumption everyone treats as untouchable, then dismantle it with evidence. "Everyone says customer retention is king. Your retention rate is 94%. You're also dying. Maybe retention is just a comfortable metric for companies afraid to find new customers."
2. **The Uncomfortable Question:** Pose a question that the reader cannot answer without confronting their own complicity. "If your strategy is so sound, why are you reading this instead of executing it?"
3. **The Inversion:** Take the conventional wisdom and flip it. "The problem isn't that NovaCorp's pivot is risky. The problem is that not pivoting has been risky for three years and nobody had the guts to say it."

### Example paragraph

NovaCorp spent four years optimizing a product the market stopped wanting two years ago. That's not strategy. That's denial with a spreadsheet. Their board called it "staying the course." Wall Street has another word for it. Now they're pivoting, and everyone's wringing their hands about the risk of change. Nobody wrung their hands about the risk of standing still while market share dropped from 23% to 14% in a single quarter. The pivot isn't the gamble. The pivot is what you do after the gamble already failed. Stop debating whether to jump. The building is on fire.

### Auto-derive rule

Select Provocateur when tone is Provocative for any audience except Academic. Also select when audience is Skeptics and tone is Provocative. For Sales/Marketing audience with Urgent tone, Provocateur may also be appropriate.

## 4. Investigator

### Description

The voice of a journalist who has spent six months on a story and is now walking you through what they found. Patient, meticulous, and quietly devastating in their conclusions.

### Sentence structure

Use measured, mid-length sentences (10-20 words). Build chains of evidence where each sentence adds one new fact, detail, or observation. Use occasional short sentences (5-8 words) as pivot points: "That number seemed wrong." Let the rhythm be accumulative: fact, fact, fact, observation, implication. Ask the reader direct questions sparingly but strategically: "Notice something?" Deploy colons and dashes to extend sentences with reveals.

### Vocabulary

Use precise, specific language. Prefer concrete details over generalizations: name the date, the document, the meeting, the number. Favor investigative verbs: "reveals," "suggests," "traces back to," "contradicts," "obscures." Avoid emotional language; let the facts generate the emotion. Use qualifiers honestly: "appears to," "the data suggests," "according to three sources." Never overstate. The understated presentation of damning evidence is more powerful than any exclamation.

### Paragraph rhythm

Build paragraphs in 3-5 sentences. Open with an observation or a piece of evidence. Develop by layering additional evidence that deepens the picture. Close by pointing toward a conclusion without quite stating it. Let the reader arrive at the "oh" moment half a sentence before you confirm it. Vary paragraph length: shorter paragraphs for reveals, longer ones for evidence-building.

### Emotional register

Maintain investigative calm on the surface. The emotion lives in the evidence itself, not in the prose. The reader should feel a growing sense of "wait, really?" as evidence accumulates. Permit yourself one moment of quiet judgment per piece, placed at the structural climax. Avoid outrage; controlled precision is more unsettling than anger.

### Signature moves

1. **The Breadcrumb Trail:** Present evidence in a sequence that lets the reader see the pattern forming before you name it. Each paragraph adds one piece. By paragraph four, the reader is ahead of you. By paragraph five, you confirm what they already suspect.
2. **The Quiet Reveal:** Deliver the most important finding in the most understated language possible. No exclamation. No emphasis. Just the fact, sitting there, doing its work. "The memo was dated three weeks before the public announcement."
3. **The "Notice Something" Beat:** Pause the narrative to invite the reader to examine the evidence themselves. "Look at those two numbers side by side. Take a moment."

### Example paragraph

In January, NovaCorp's internal strategy deck projected 22% growth for the legacy product line. By March, the same team revised that to 9%. By June, the slide had been removed entirely. What replaced it was a single page titled "Cloud Transition Framework" with a timeline beginning in Q2. No explanation for the revision. No postmortem on the original projection. The public earnings call in July still referenced "strong fundamentals in our core business." The pivot memo, obtained from three independent sources, was dated April 12 -- eleven weeks before the CEO told analysts everything was on track. Draw your own conclusions. Or rather, notice that you already have.

### Auto-derive rule

Select Investigator when audience is Technical or Skeptics and tone is Provocative or Balanced. Also select when audience is Skeptics and tone is Authoritative or Urgent. Strong fit for post-mortem and case study content types.

---

## 5. Storyteller

### Description

The voice that makes you forget you are reading a business document. Characters, scenes, and moments carry the argument because humans remember stories, not bullet points.

### Sentence structure

Vary sentence length to match the emotional beat. Use short, clipped sentences for tension: "The dashboard turned red." Use longer, flowing sentences for context and scene-setting. Open scenes with sensory detail or a specific moment in time. Include dialogue -- actual quoted speech from real or composite characters. Favor active, cinematic verbs: "slammed," "whispered," "scrolled," "stared." Write sentences that could open a chapter of a book.

### Vocabulary

Use vivid, sensory language. Prefer concrete nouns you can see, hear, or touch: "the fluorescent hum of the third-floor conference room" over "the meeting space." Name characters by role or name when possible: "the CTO," "Maria from product," "the intern who noticed first." Ban abstraction: show the concept through a scene, never explain it in the abstract. Use present tense for key scenes to create immediacy. Use metaphors drawn from the physical world, not the business world.

### Paragraph rhythm

Build paragraphs in 3-6 sentences. Open scenes with a grounding detail: time, place, or sensory anchor. Develop through character action and reaction. Close scenes with a line that carries emotional weight or narrative tension. Alternate between scene paragraphs (showing) and brief bridge paragraphs (1-2 sentences of context or reflection). Let the story breathe. Pacing matters more than compression.

### Emotional register

Emotion is carried by the characters and the scenes, not by the narrator's commentary. Show the CEO's hands shaking, not "the CEO was nervous." Let the reader feel what the characters feel through specific, observed detail. The narrator's voice is warm but restrained: a documentarian, not a cheerleader. Permit moments of quiet emotion -- the kind that lands in the chest, not the kind that demands a reaction.

### Signature moves

1. **The Cold Open:** Begin with a specific, vivid scene that drops the reader into the middle of the action. No context. No setup. "It was 2am on a Tuesday when the dashboard turned red." Context comes after the reader is already hooked.
2. **The Human Detail:** Anchor every strategic decision in a human moment. Not "the board approved the pivot" but "the CFO closed her laptop, looked across the table, and said: 'If we don't do this now, there won't be a board meeting next quarter.'"
3. **The Echo:** End the piece by returning to an image or detail from the opening, now transformed by everything the reader has learned.

### Example paragraph

It was 11:47pm on a Thursday when Priya Anand, NovaCorp's VP of Product, pulled up the market share dashboard for the third time that day. The number hadn't changed. Fourteen percent. She could hear the cleaning crew vacuuming two floors below. Six months ago, the same screen had read twenty-three, and she'd walked past it without a second glance. Now she screenshot it, dropped it into a Slack message to the CEO, and typed four words: "We need to talk." By Friday morning, there were eleven people in a conference room that seated eight, a whiteboard covered in arrows pointing away from the legacy product, and a single Post-it note on the wall that read "$40M -- 18 months -- no guarantees." The intern who'd been asked to take notes looked around the room and realized no one was pretending anymore.

### Auto-derive rule

Select Storyteller when tone is Warm for any audience. Also select when audience is General Public and tone is Playful. Strong fit for origin story, case study, and post-mortem content types regardless of other parameters.

## 6. Academic

### Description

The voice of a tenured researcher presenting at a peer-reviewed conference. Precision is not a preference; it is an obligation. Every claim earns its place through evidence and methodology.

### Sentence structure

Use longer, precisely constructed sentences (15-30 words). Include qualifiers, citations, and methodological notes within the sentence structure. Employ semicolons and em-dashes to layer related ideas within a single grammatical unit. Use parenthetical asides for methodological caveats: "(N=847, p<.01, controlling for firm size and sector)." Place the most important finding at the end of the sentence, not the beginning. Allow complex sentence structures when precision requires it, but never sacrifice clarity for sophistication.

### Vocabulary

Use scholarly register. Prefer discipline-specific terminology when writing for expert audiences; define terms on first use when writing for broader readers. Favor precise verbs: "correlates with," "suggests," "is consistent with," "contradicts prior findings," "warrants further investigation." Ban casual intensifiers: no "very," "really," "incredibly." Replace them with quantified descriptors: "a 3.2 standard deviation increase." Use hedging language appropriately and intentionally: "the evidence suggests" (not proven), "appears to" (not certain), "in the majority of observed cases" (not always).

### Paragraph rhythm

Build paragraphs in 4-7 sentences. Open with the claim or finding being presented. Follow with the evidence base: methodology, sample, key statistics. Develop through interpretation and connection to existing literature. Close by noting limitations or directions for further investigation. Maintain consistent paragraph length; the uniformity signals rigor. Use transitional phrases that signal logical relationships: "Conversely," "Building on this finding," "A notable exception."

### Emotional register

Suppress personal emotion entirely. Let intellectual excitement emerge through the precision and significance of findings. The closest thing to emotion is measured surprise at a counterintuitive result: "Contrary to the prevailing consensus, the data reveal..." Express stakes through implications, not appeals: "If replicated, this finding challenges the foundational assumption of..." Never advocate. Present, analyze, qualify, and allow the evidence to argue its own case.

### Signature moves

1. **The Methodological Anchor:** Ground every claim in visible methodology. The reader should always know how you know what you claim to know. "A longitudinal analysis of 847 mid-cap firms over 36 months, controlling for sector and geographic distribution, reveals..."
2. **The Literature Contrast:** Position findings against the existing body of knowledge. "While Chen & Rodriguez (2024) found that pivots correlate with short-term revenue decline, our analysis suggests the relationship is moderated by pre-pivot R&D investment levels."
3. **The Qualified Conclusion:** End with a conclusion that acknowledges its own boundaries. Never overstate. "These findings are suggestive rather than definitive, and the relatively small sample of firms that completed full strategic pivots (n=34) limits generalizability."

### Example paragraph

A longitudinal analysis of 847 mid-cap technology firms that executed strategic pivots between 2019 and 2024 reveals a bimodal distribution in outcomes that challenges the conventional narrative of pivot-as-survival-mechanism. Firms in the top quartile of pre-pivot R&D investment (>12% of revenue) achieved a mean 34% increase in market capitalization within 24 months post-pivot (SD=11.2, p<.001); firms in the bottom quartile experienced a mean decline of 19% (SD=14.7, p<.01). NovaCorp's proposed reallocation of $40M -- representing approximately 8.3% of trailing twelve-month revenue -- positions it near the median of the sample, a range associated with highly variable outcomes (coefficient of variation=0.89). It is worth noting that market share erosion velocity, such as NovaCorp's 9-percentage-point decline in a single quarter, was a stronger predictor of post-pivot success than the absolute investment figure (beta=0.47, p<.005), suggesting that urgency itself may function as an organizational catalyst. These findings warrant cautious optimism but should not be interpreted as predictive for any individual case.

### Auto-derive rule

Select Academic when audience is Academic or Technical and tone is Authoritative or Balanced. Also select when audience is Skeptics and tone is Balanced. Strong fit for research findings, policy recommendation, and methodology-heavy content types.

## 7. Dry Wit

### Description

The voice that delivers the most serious insight in the least serious wrapper. If the Boardroom voice respects your time, the Dry Wit voice respects your intelligence.

### Sentence structure

Keep sentences mostly short to mid-length (6-15 words). Use deadpan declarative sentences that deliver the punchline without signaling it. Place the subversive word or phrase at the end of the sentence where it detonates on impact. Follow a witty observation immediately with a straight-faced factual sentence; the contrast amplifies both. Never write a setup line that telegraphs the joke. Deploy parenthetical asides as dry commentary. Use understatement as the default mode: say less than you mean and trust the reader to close the gap.

### Vocabulary

Use smart, precise language with an undercurrent of irony. Prefer understated words: "notable," "curious," "somewhat," "one might observe." Ban exclamation points entirely. Ban obvious sarcasm markers (no "/s," no "shocking," no "surprise, surprise"). Let the reader feel clever for catching the implication. Mix business vocabulary with unexpected everyday language for comic contrast: "The synergy, as it were, between their ambition and their bank account was imperfect." Use formal phrasing to describe informal realities.

### Paragraph rhythm

Build paragraphs in 2-4 sentences. Open with a seemingly straightforward observation. Develop with a detail that subtly undercuts or complicates it. Close with a line that rewards attentive readers. Keep the overall rhythm brisk; wit dies in long paragraphs. Alternate between observational paragraphs and brief deadpan one-liners. Never explain the joke. If the reader doesn't get it, the next paragraph moves on.

### Emotional register

Maintain surface-level detachment at all times. The emotion lives entirely in the subtext. Genuine affection, concern, or outrage appears only through what is conspicuously left unsaid. The voice is warm underneath -- it cares enough to be disappointed -- but it will never admit that directly. Think of a British understatement during a crisis: "This is, perhaps, less than ideal."

### Signature moves

1. **The Deadpan Pivot:** State something alarming in the most casual possible language. "NovaCorp's market share declined by nine points in a quarter, which is one way to get the board's attention."
2. **The Conspicuous Omission:** Describe a situation in careful, neutral terms that make the absurdity self-evident. Do not comment on it. Simply present the facts and move on, leaving the reader to supply the reaction.
3. **The Formal Understatement:** Use overly precise or formal language to describe something chaotic, emotional, or obviously disastrous. "The subsequent all-hands meeting was, by several accounts, spirited."

### Example paragraph

NovaCorp's leadership spent four years refining a product that the market had, with some delicacy, stopped purchasing. Their market share performed the rare feat of declining from 23% to 14% in a single quarter, which suggests the market's delicacy had limits. The proposed remedy is a $40M pivot to cloud services, a figure that represents either a bold strategic investment or an expensive admission that the previous bold strategic investment did not go as planned. The 18-month timeline is described internally as "ambitious," a word that in corporate usage means "we would also accept 24." To their credit, NovaCorp's board voted to proceed, which is easier to do once the alternative is sufficiently mathematical. One does wish them well.

### Auto-derive rule

Select Dry Wit when tone is Playful for any audience except General Public, where Storyteller better fits the accessible, story-first register. Also appropriate as a secondary voice option when the content involves failure analysis or post-mortems and the audience can handle levity.

## Auto-Derive Mapping Matrix

During the Build Brief phase, use the audience (from Discovery Question 1) and tone (from Discovery Question 4) to auto-select a voice. Find the audience row and tone column; the intersection is the recommended voice.

| | **Authoritative** | **Provocative** | **Warm** | **Urgent** | **Balanced** | **Visionary** | **Playful** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Executive** | Boardroom | Provocateur | Storyteller | Boardroom | Boardroom | TED Stage | Dry Wit |
| **Technical** | Academic | Investigator | Investigator | Boardroom | Academic | TED Stage | Dry Wit |
| **Sales/Marketing** | TED Stage | Provocateur | Storyteller | Provocateur | TED Stage | TED Stage | Dry Wit |
| **Investors** | Boardroom | Provocateur | Storyteller | Boardroom | Boardroom | TED Stage | Dry Wit |
| **General Public** | TED Stage | Provocateur | Storyteller | TED Stage | TED Stage | TED Stage | Storyteller |
| **Skeptics** | Investigator | Provocateur | Storyteller | Investigator | Academic | Investigator | Dry Wit |
| **Mixed** | TED Stage | TED Stage | Storyteller | Boardroom | TED Stage | TED Stage | Dry Wit |
| **Academic** | Academic | Academic | Investigator | Academic | Academic | TED Stage | Dry Wit |

### How to Use This Matrix

1. Identify the audience from Discovery Question 1.
2. Identify the tone from Discovery Question 4.
3. Look up the intersection.
4. Present the auto-derived voice to the user with a brief description.
5. Offer override: "I'd suggest the **[Voice]** voice for this piece. Want me to use it, or would you prefer a different voice?"

### Override Rules

- The user can always override the auto-derived voice. Their explicit request takes priority.
- If the user describes a voice without naming one ("write it like a detective uncovering a scandal"), match to the closest profile (Investigator, in this case).
- If the user requests a blend ("Boardroom but with some humor"), use the primary voice's rules and selectively incorporate 1-2 signature moves from the secondary voice.
- If no tone is specified, default to Balanced and derive from there.
